<p>Dear Mr McWeeney</p>

<p>I refer to your 
<a href="/blog/2013/10/26/ooo-o.html" > recent letter to this Office</a>
in connection with 
{% include m/longford_county_council.span content="Longford County Council" %}
about the Council's failure to respond to 
<a href="/blog/2013/03/28/lcc-o.html" > your correspondence</a> 
issued in March 2013.
I understand you have recently received a 
<a href="/blog/2013/04/11/lcc-i.html" > letter from Longford County Council</a>
(Director of Services) setting out the Council position
with regard to your substantive complaint.
</p>

<p>
As discussed during our recent telephone conversation,
you will need to write to the 
{% include m/office_of_the_ombudsman.span content="Ombudsman" %} 
again setting out what aspects of the Council's response
you are dissatisfied with
and what you would like the Council to do 
in order to remedy your complaint.
</p>

<p>In the meantime, I will be closing your case.</p>
