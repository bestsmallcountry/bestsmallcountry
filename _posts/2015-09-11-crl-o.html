<div class="ref">

Dear Barry,

</div>


<p>I refer to your refusal on Saturday 18th July 2015, 
to admit me to the facility, and to your understanding 
that you were not to admit me without specific instructions 
to the effect that you could do so.
</p>

<p>
These instructions as you said would need to be received 
from the board of directors. For that reason, 
I brought away a letterhead printed by you, listing those members: 
T. Caffrey, D. Rooney, F. Sheridan, B. Lynch, P. Loughrey, 
R. McNiven, M. Murphy, J. Browne, G. Warnock. 
</p>

<p>
You had undertaken to make contact with me, with a view to confirming that you had followed
correct procedure, and confirmed that you had my contact details. Contrary to your promise, no
contact was made.
</p>

<p>
I would remind you that you were a participant in events in 2012 and 2013 which led to my
exclusion from the facility, and given your recent refusal of admission, there is no conclusion I can
reach, other than that you are, to no lesser extent than the board, a participant in the discrimination
I'm being subjected to.
</p>

<p>
Please be advised that I will relentlessly pursue the vindication of my good name, as I've been
doing, until such time as the truth of these matters is known, and the matter is resolved to my
satisfaction. I await the overdue contact.
</p>
