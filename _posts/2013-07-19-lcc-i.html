Dear Mr. McWeeney,<br />
<br />
</div>

<p>
I refer to your recent your
<a href="/blog/2013/06/04/lcc-o.html" > Freedom of Information request</a> 
to Longford Sports and Leisure Ltd. 
seeking <cite><em>ALL data held about me personally</em></cite>.
</p>

<p>
At the outset I wish to advise that the FOI Act confers a right, subject to any 
relevant exemptions, of access to written records that exist rather than 
a right to have <cite>ALL</em> questions in <em>ALL</em> of the aforementioned
correspondence answered.</cite>
The FOI legislation does not provide a mechanism for answering questions.
In addition, the FOI Act does not impose an obligation on a public body
to create a record where none exists.
</p>

<p>I, also, wish to advise that it is not my function as a decision maker under FOI 
to respond to, comment on or engage with the substantive issues of concern to you 
in relation to Longford Sports and Leisure Centre.
</p>

<p>My decision, therefore, to grant you access to your personal records is made 
only in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.
</p>

<p>In fulfillment of your request I enclose copies of the following records:
</p>
