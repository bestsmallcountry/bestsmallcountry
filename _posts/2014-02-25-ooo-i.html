<p>Dear Mr McWeeney</p>

<p>
I refer to your correspondence with this Office in connection with a complaint
against Longford County Council.
</p>
<p>
I have completed a detailed review of the evidence available in your case 
including the Council's report on the matter and the information you submitted 
in support of your case.  I regret to inform you that based on the available 
information, I am not in a position to uphold your complaint.  I have set out 
the reasons for my decision below.</p>

<h1>Your complaint</h1>
<p>
Your complaint centres around your suspension from the Swimming Pool in 
Longford.  Your contention is that this entire affair was a poorly thought up 
stitch-up, designed to inflict maximum distress on a vulnerable adult.  During 
this period you suffered from the berievement of your mother and you believe 
that there was a viscious mob, determined to amputate your social circle by 
keeping you out of the swimming pool, with or without justification.
</p>
<p>
Subsequently you state that the line of command in Longford County Council up 
to County Manager closed ranks, by not corresponding with you, and continuing 
the "wall of silence" tactics during your dealings with them.  You also added 
that:
</p>

<ul>
<li>No established process was followed by the Council when assessing your 
case</li>
<li>You weer never consulted or asked about the "incident", and as a result 
was not allowed to defend yourself</li>
<li>You were not informed "at each step" as stated by the Council</li>
<li>You were told by Cllr Peggy Nolan that an apology was in the post only 
to subsequently be suspended</li>
<li>The Council has deliberately omitted information from his FOI requests, 
namely the names of those at the meeting where there was a unanimous decision 
to suspend him, and</li>
<li>The Council has not clearly ourlined what "the decision" consists of</li>
</ul>

<h2>Longford County Council's Report</h2>
<p>On receipt of your complaint this Office, I wrote to Longford County 
Council and requested a detailed report from the Council regarding your 
particular case.  <mark>A detailed report was sent to this Office by the Council 
on 12 February 2014 from Mr Dan Rooney</mark>, Secretary to Longford Sports and 
Leisure Ltd.</p>

<p>Some of the main details from this very detailed report were:</p>

<h3>Reason for Suspension</h3>
<p>Mr McWeeney was banned from the Swimming Pool because the Pool Manager 
received a number of complaints from other pool users regarding his conduct 
while in the pool.  These complaints can be summarised as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bullying in the lane while swimming.  This is best described by 
overtaking in the lane and then obstructing by cutting in front of the 
swimmer with subsequent verbal abuse.  On one particular occasion the injured 
party in the incident complaint of being kicked on 2 occasions</li>
<li>When Mr McWeeney was spoken to by Pool staff in relation to these 
incidents he was abusive, rude and used bad language on a number of 
occasions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chronological List of Events</h3>
<p><u>19 July 2012 -</u>
Letter from Secretary/Director of the Company to you informing you that the 
Council had received a number of complaints against you.  In the letter the 
Secretary stated
<cite>
You are a valued customer to our facility but if we receive any more 
complaints of this nature we will be forced to refuse you entry to the 
facility.  We trust with your cooperation with the Centre rules and staff, we
can continue to serve your leisure needs.
</cite>
</p>

<p>
<u>23 July 2012 -</u>
Response from you to the Council letter of 19 July 2012.
</p>

<p>
<u>17 October 2012 -</u>
Letter issued to you from Mr Dan Rooney, in response to your correspondence 
of 19 July 2012.  This letter was issued following the Swimming Pool 
Management Board reviewing your previous correspondence.  In this letter, 
the history of the case was outlined including the individual complaints made 
about your behaviour in the pool.
The letter requested that you consider the history of the case as outlined 
and asked you for your response in due course.  Mr Rooney went on to ask you 
to provide your comments in relation to these matters in writing within the 
next 14 days.  He added that the Pool Authority would take into account what 
you have to say, which appeared on the face of it to be serious.
He also said that is it possible that the Pool Authority may make a decision 
to suspend you from using the Pool.  Before the Authority were to give 
consideration to this they wanted to hear from you with any response that you 
wanted to make.
</p>

<p>
<u>20 October 2012 -</u>
Response from you to the Council letter of 17 October 2012.  In this letter 
you concluded that Mr Rooney and Mr Sheridan had fabricated in this case 
together and had contrived to cause you maximum distress, which they 
succeeded in that goal.  You requested a Full Apology and a Withdrawal from 
the Council by the end of that week, 26 October 2012.
</p>


<p>
<u>4 January 2013 -</u>
Letter from Mr Dan Rooney, Company Secretary to you stating that Longford 
Sports and Leisure Ltd had considered the complaints against you were 
justified and a decision had been made to suspend you from future use of the 
Leisure Centre with immediate effect.
</p>

<p>
The Council also attached copies of the Complaints made against you, the 
notes made by staff of Longford Sports and Leisure Ltd noting the separate 
incidents, the Terms and Conditions of Membership and Pool Rules.
</p>

<p>
Mr Rooney, Secretary stated in his correspondence to this Office that there 
is no formal appeals procedure in place.  He added, however the letter sent 
to you of 17 October 2012 gave you an opportunity to put your side regarding 
the incidents but you failed to do so.
</p>

<h3>The role of the Ombudsman</h3>
<p>
The Ombudsman may examine actions carried out by certain public bodies, where 
there is evidence to suggest that maladministration (i.e., improper, 
incorrect or unfair administration) has occurred and the action complained of 
has had an adverse effect on the complainant.  In the absense of evidence of 
maladministration and adverse effect, there is no basis for pursuing a 
complaint with a body.
</p>

<h3>The view of this Office</h3>
<p>
The Council wrote to you on 17 October 2012 outlining the separate complaints 
made about you to them by members of the public and they did ask you to 
provide your comments in relation to these matters in writing within the next 
14 days.  They also added that the Pool Authority would take into account 
what you had to say regarding these serious allegations.
</p>
<p>
The complaints made against you certainly appear to be legitimate, made by 
ordinary members of the public who were using the public swimming pool just 
like you.  In your reply to the Council of 20 October 2012 you did not reply 
to the specific allegations  or complaints made against you.
</p>
<p>
While there is no appeals procedures in place, I believe the Council acted 
reasonably by giving you an opportunity to put your side of events regarding 
the complaints before they made a decision on the complaints.  They were 
entitled to believe that these complaints were genuine.  I cannot find that 
the administrative actions in this case by the Council were unfair in how 
they dealt with your case, therefore I cannot uphold your complaint against 
them.
</p>

<p>
I have to balance the specific complaints made about you against your version 
of events.  Clearly there are two accounts of what happened during your 
interactions with staff from the Council, yours and that of the Council 
staff.  On the basis of the information available it is clear that, as things 
stand, there is a conflict between your position and the Council's in 
relation to this matter.  I hope you will appreciate that this is one of 
those instances where there are two different versions of events and in the 
circumstances, it is not possible to establish without doubt which position 
is correct.  This conclusion does not mean to imply that your version of 
events is not correct but rather that a detailed examination of the matter is 
unlikely to provide an objective basis to reconcile the conflicting accounts 
of what happened on the days in question.
</p>

<p>
Under these circumstances, I hope you will appreciate that where there are 
different accounts of events or a conflict of evidence, this Office would not 
be in a position to categorically arrive at a definitive conclusion in the 
matter.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
While I appreciate that you may be disappointed with the outcome of my 
examination, based on all the information available to me, this Office can 
find no evidence of maladministration by the Council in this case.
</p>

<p>
I hope the above clarifies the position for you and I regret that, other than 
explain the position to you, I cannot be of further assistance to you on this 
occasion.  Accordingly I am now closing your file.
</p>
