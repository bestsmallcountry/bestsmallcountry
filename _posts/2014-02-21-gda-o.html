Dear Inspector Nicholson,

</div>

<p> I am deeply dissatisfied with the response to date to 
<a href="/blog/2014/01/06/gda-o.html">my recent registered letter to the 
Garda Commissioner</a>. 
The intention at the time was to have all issues raised in 
<a href="/blog/2013/06/22/gda-o.html">my letter of 22 Jun 2013</a> fully addressed.
</p>

<p>Two <em>standard letters</em> and about five weeks later, 
I finally met with Community Policing on Wednesday 12 Feb 2014 at 
Longford Garda Station.  I have no issue with Community Policing and 
resent that they were deployed by you to avoid addressing me yourself.<p>

<p>Contrary to the position you outlined in 
<a href="/blog/2013/12/05/gda-i.html">your correspondence of 05 Dec 2013</a>, 
this dispute <em>DOES</em> relate to An Garda Siochana 
as of the time of my meeting with the retired Superintendent, 
Denis Shiels on 24 Jul 2013. </p>

<p>At this meeting, there was <em><b>no apology for</b></em> the 

<ul>
	<li><em>&quot;mislaid&quot; correspondence</em>,</li> 
	<li>no reference to the misidentification 
		of the Garda who attended the mall,</li> 
	<li>no impartiality, and most importantly, 
	<li>no answers provided to me.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The Superintendent in my opinion, did everything possible to 
<em><b>protect Mr. Dan Rooney regardless of the facts</b></em>, 
and intended to <em><b>deter me from pursuing the matter further</b></em>. 
</p>

<p>For those reasons, I conclude that he voluntarily involved himself 
in a civil matter, on the side opposing me.</p>

<p>It would appear from 
<a href="/blog/2013/12/05/gda-i.html">your correspondence of 05 Dec 2013</a> 
to my solicitor, that you are providing continuity to the Superintendent's position.</p>

<p><em><b>I am particularly incensed and insulted that you direct me 
to the precise perpetrator of the malevolent complaint, 
to establish it's nature, when it's already on your desk.</b></em></p>

<p>Having done nothing wrong, and having made every effort 
to diplomatically establish the facts, I now, for the last time, 
request that the following criteria are addressed by you in writing:
<ul>
	<li>An acknowlegment and acceptance that the 
		complaint of 25 Mar 2013 made by Mr. Dan Rooney 
		was indeed malevolent.</li>
	<li>A full description of the nature of this complaint, 
		which I believe I am entitled to.</li>
	<li>Confirmation of the geographical bounds of the area 
		from which I had/have been restricted, at the Mall Complex.</li>
	<li>Confirmation that there are no blemishes recorded 
		against my character at Longford Garda Station or on Pulse.</li>
	<li>An apology for your failure to personally take responsibility 
		for the <em><b>MONTHS of upset</b></em> 
		your correspondence has caused.</li>
	<li>An apology for directing me to the perpetrator for answers, 
		and for your failure to take any action against him.</li>
</ul>

Should the above not be addressed to my satisfaction within 10 working days, 
I intend to refer the matter without further notice to the 
Garda Siochana Ombudsman Commission with whom I've already spoken.</p>
