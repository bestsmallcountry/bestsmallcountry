<p>Dear Minister Fitzgerald,</p>


<p>
I understand that you are presently accepting submissions for "Panel Review", 
and would be very grateful if my case could be included. 
I will give you a very condensed summary of a very extensive archive.</p>

<p>
I have registered letters to both the former 
<a href="/blog/2014/01/06/gda-o.html">Garda Commissioner</a> (6 Jan 2014) and 
to <a href="/blog/2014/07/02/ooo-o.html">the Ombudsman</a> (2 Jul 2014) 
after having exhausted all lesser options, 
including <a href="/blog/2013/06/04/lcc-o.html">Freedom of Information</a> and 
<a href="/blog/2014/03/27/ooo-o.html">Data Protection</a>, 
and have still had <a href="/blog/2013/10/26/ooo-o.html">not one answer</a>.
</p>

<p>
I have done nothing wrong, but <a href="/blog/2012/10/17/lcc-i2.html">malicious people</a>, 
some of whom I've yet to identify, plotted <a href="/blog/2013/01/04/lcc-i.html">to keep me out</a> 
of Longford Swimming Pool, terminating a valid membership.</p>

<p>
<em>Two of the fabricators, one being a public official, 
{% include m/dan_rooney.span content="Dan Rooney" %} (soon to retire), 
set themselves up as arbitrators, leaving me no hope of impartiality or transparency.</em>
</p>

<p>
This same public official, Dan Rooney (25 Mar 2013) ordered Gardai 
to remove me from the public park, &quot;The Mall&quot; where the pool is located, 
to prevent me meeting fellow swimmers and gathering information.
</p>

<p>
Subsequently I met with the then Superintendent (24 Jul 2013) 
in an effort to establish what I was supposed to have done, 
the bounds of the restriction, and why the attending Garda 
on moving me on, commented that the park was &quot;used by children&quot;, 
a very insulting and upsetting remark.
</p>

<p>
The Superintendents attitude left me in no doubt 
that I was a citizen of lesser importance, 
and was dismissive to the point of being rude. 
I left his office absolutely crushed and devastated. 
The present situation regarding use of the park is 
that if the Gardai are called like before, 
the same thing is liable to recur.
</p>


<p>
I have lost trust in the Office of the Ombudsman 
because they <a href="/blog/2014/02/25/ooo-i.html">wrongly accepted a defamatory report</a> 
about me as &quot;information&quot;, 
citing the conflicting versions of events as the reason 
for not upholding my complaint.
</p>

<p>
The case is officially now at &quot;appeal&quot; stage 
<em>but I will not be cooperating</em> 
until concerns I've expressed have been addressed, the main ones being 
a committment to an oral hearing, 
and <em>being allowed details of what I'm expected to rebut</em>, 
and that I will have no further opportunities to comment or update 
as information comes to hand.
</p>

<p>
My hope in making this submission is that you can address the specific issue 
of public officials having the ability to misdeploy Gardai. 
Contrary to the Garda Charter, 
my experience has been that I am a lesser citizen, 
and <em>inappropriate personal relationships are impeding Gardai</em> 
in general from doing their jobs.  I am one such victim.
</p>

<p>
Many thanks for your attention, and I hope you will be in contact 
for further details from my archives.  I very much look forward to hearing from you.
