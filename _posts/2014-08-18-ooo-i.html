<p>Dear Mr McWeeney,</p>
<p>I refer to previous correspondence in connection with your appeal of this 
Office's decision not to uphold your complaint against Longford County Council.

In line with the Office's appeals procedure, I have asked Mr Sean Garvey, 
Senior Investigator, to examine your appeal.  It is expected that your appeal 
will be completed within 4-6 weeks. If it appears, however, that the appeal 
will take longer than expected, Mr Garvey will advise you accordingly.
