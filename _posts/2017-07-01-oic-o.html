Dear {% include m/ombudsman.span content="Mr. Tyndall," %}
</p>
<p>
I am utterly disgusted with the 
<a href="/blog/2017/06/16/oic-i.html" >response</a> 
to my 
<a href="/blog/2017/06/15/oic-o.html">formal complaint</a>, 
issued to your office by registered post on
15<sup>th</sup> June 2017, which entirely, and I believe deliberately, 
<em>mischaracterised</em> the nature of my grievances, as being a <em>request</em> 
for a <i>review of the decision made by Longford County Council</i>. 
It is much deeper than that.
</p>
<p>
Consequently, I have not quoted the reference number 
communicated to me by Patricia Kenna on 16<sup>th</sup> June 2017, as by doing so, 
I would be conceding this matter to be a regular case like any other on your books.
<em>Neither do I accept</em>, as alluded to, that there is an element of 
<em>discretion</em> regarding whether or not to accept my application. 
I previously quoted official information that clearly states that 
this is precisely your function.
</p>

<p>
At a cursory glance, as well as being a member of SIPO, you hold office as 
<em>Ombudsman</em>, <em>Information Commissioner</em> and 
<em>Commissioner for Environmental Information</em>. All of these are listed on
<a href="http://foi.gov.ie/all-foi-bodies/">http://foi.gov.ie/all-foi-bodies/</a> 
and are positions of trust involving elements of watchdog and oversight, 
and are subject to Freedom of Information legislation. 
You are well rewarded by the state for providing these functions 
with stable salary and pension, regardless of performance.
</p>

<p>
As an ordinary law-abiding citizen of this country, 
it is not my duty or function to call to account, 
those who are supposed to call others to account, 
and do so as a free service. At the same time, 
all who I have named in my affidavit, including yourself, 
continue to squander as much of my time and energy as humanly possible.
</p>

<p>
I am very curious as to how it is proposed that my <i>real</i> grievances be addressed. 
I have been asked to provide email and telephone contact details in the
<a href="/blog/2017/06/16/oic-i.html" >response from your office</a>. 
These details are already at your offices in the files 
<em>L30/13/1493</em> (examination) and <em>L30/13/1772</em> (appeal). 
Even had they not been, there would still be communication difficulties 
because my emails are quarantined and do not reach addresses @longfordcoco.ie, 
which would prevent me copying them on any communication with this office.
</p>

<p>
Given the nature of the <em>primary grievances</em>, against 
<em>Longford County Council</em> and the <em>Office of the Ombudsman</em>, 
it is impossible for me to fathom how the required investigation 
would practically proceed. 
As I understand it, the functions you perform are all done from the same address, 
and with the <em>same pool of staff</em>. 
While I am clear that each of these functions are legally separate, 
I canâ€™t visualise how co-workers could go possibly together for coffee, 
and then return to investigate each other, and you investigate yourself!
</p>

<p>
So as to be absolutely clear, and so as to not misconstrue 
outstanding matters, I repeat my issues yet again:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
As a matter of natural justice, I am also formally requesting that a 
false and <em>defamatory report</em>, 
sent to the Office of the Ombudsman in 2013, be provided to me for correction.
</p>
<p>
To be absolutely clear, Longford Co. Co. have displayed two fingers 
to both the spirit and the letter of the Freedom of Information Act 2014. 
It is your brief to to ensure that FOI bodies comply with the provisions 
of the legislation, so it is incumbent on you to take corrective action. 
There must be <em>no exemptions for lies</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>
Finally, had a pre-paid envelope been actually provided, 
I would still have elected to register this letter.
