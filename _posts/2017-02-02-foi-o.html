<p>Hi Ciara,</p>

<p>
{% include m/paddy_mahon.span content="Longford Co. Co." %}

{% include m/ronan_mcnevin.span content="and" %}

<a href="/blog/2017/02/02/foi-o.html" > "the relevant records"</a> 
to all that I have outlined below.  
This response was as a result of correspondence that included an 
<a href="/blog/2014/11/06/affidavit1.html" >affidavit</a> 
reflecting what truly happened, 
and questions regarding why I'm being denied access to councilors 
by having my emails quarantined.
</p>

<p> 
The entire response is attached and has not been doctored.  
I also note that this was received on 26th January 2017.  
This is particularly significant given the miserable morsel of 
&quot;information&quot; provided, and the &quot;convenient&quot; 
deferral of discussions in relation to me:

<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>Mark McNerney circulated correspondence received 
from the following to the board members:
</p>
<ul><li>Mel McWeeney, -Letter dated 14th November
address to Paddy Mahon Chair of the board.
The Board Members decided to defer this matter
to the next meeting of the Board scheduled
for mid January 2017</li></ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<em>I hope the attitude towards both the spirit and the letter of the law 
in relation to Freedom of Information is more than obvious from this, 
in that I'm basically being told that I'm asking about the wrong meeting.</em> 
Note also that the timeline from the November request 
(which was never assigned a Case Number) has long since expired.  
This is the FOURTH FOI breach in relation to this matter.
</p>

<p>
I should also point out that this was already supposed to have been investigated 
by <em>the Office of the Ombudsman</em> (Case L30/13/1772).  
{% include m/office_of_the_ombudsman.span content="That Office" %}
<em>was entirely derelict in it's duties</em>, and as a result I can have confidence 
neither in an &quot;internal review&quot; by a more senior bully in Longford Co. Co., 
nor in the same staff in the Office of the Ombudsman 
masquerading in the spots of the Office of the Information Commissioner, 
and reporting the the same individual.
<p>
What I really want now is concrete information regarding how I can prosecute 
those responsible for this fourth breach as it is having a devastating effect 
on my daily life.  
I hope you have some advice you can give, or someone you can refer me to.  
Much as I've searched, I haven't managed to see mention of consequences 
for those prosecuted under FOI.
