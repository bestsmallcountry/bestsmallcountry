<p>Hi Mel,</p>

<p>
I am sorry that you are not satisfied.  
All we can do is set out the process to be followed under the Act.  
If you donâ€™t received a reply within the timeframe you can look for an internal review.  
Following on from that if you are still not satisfied 
you can appeal to the Office of the Information Commissioner.
</p>


<p>
We cannot advise on any matter outside of the Act.
</p>

<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
