<p>
I refer to your recent your
<a href="/blog/2013/06/04/lcc-o.html" > Freedom of Information request</a> seeking records 
that may be held by
Longford Sports and Leisure Ltd. in relation to policies and procedures.
</p>
<p>
My decision is to part-grant your request in accordance with the provisions of 
Freedom of Information legislation.
</p>

<p>I enclose copies of available written records:</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>A copy of the Data Protection Policy;
the Access Policy in the form of the <em>Terms and Conditions</em> of Membership
<em>(which refers to biometrics)</em> and a copy of the Pool Rules.
Such policies were in place in 2012
</li>
<li>
Copies of personal correspondence;
company correspondence to you and copies of your membership forms
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
I find that I must refuse access to the Complaints Response / Disciplinary Procedures in 
accordance with Section 10 of the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 - 2003 which states:
<cite>a head to whom a request under section 7 is made may refuse to grant the request if
(a) the record concerned does not exist or cannot be found
after all reasonable steps to ascertain its whereabouts have been taken
</cite>.
</p>

<p>If you are not satisfied with the decision on your request you may apply in writing 
within 4 weeks (ie: 20 working days) to the Senior Executive Officer, Human Resources, 
Longford County Council, Gt. Water St., Longford for an internal review.

In accordance with the Freedom of Information (Fees) Regulations, 2003 a standard 
fee of <b>€75</b> must accompany an application for an internal review under Section 14.

The appeal will involve a complete reconsideration of the matter by a more senior member 
of staff at Longford County Council.
