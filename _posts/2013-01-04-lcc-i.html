Dear Mr. McWeeney,<br />
</div>

<p>I refer to <a href="/blog/2012/07/23/lcc-o.html" >my 
detailed letter to you </a> of 12<sup>th</sup>
October 2012.
Longford Sports and Leisure Limited have now considered the 
<a title="organised by themselves"> complaints</a> with care.
In considering the complaints which have been made against you,
the County Longford Sports and Leisure Centre
have taken into account the issues which you have raised in
<a href="/blog/2012/10/20/lcc-o.html" >your letter</a> 
of 20<sup>th</sup> October 2012.
The company have also taken into account the complaints that
were made against you.
</p>

<p>Following careful consideration, the company have found
that the complaints against you <em>are justified</em>.
A decision has been made 
to suspend you from future use of the Leisure Centre at the Mall,
Templemichael, Longford, with immediate effect.
</p>

<aside>
<h3>One address on the envelope, another on the letter</h3>
Was this dictated at a Christmas party?
Count what was <cite>considered</cite> how many times.
