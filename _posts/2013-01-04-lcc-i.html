Longford Sports and Leisure Limited have now considered the 
<a title="organised by themselves"> complaints</a> with care.
In considering the complaints which have been made against you,
the County Longford Sports and Leisure Centre
have taken into account the issues which you have raised in
<a href="/blog/2012/10/20/lcc-o.html" >your letter</a> 
of 20<sup>th</sup> October 2012.
The company have also taken into account the complaints that
were made against you.

<p>Following careful consideration, the company have found
that the complaints against you <em>are justified</em>.

<h3>One address on the envelope, another on the letter</h3>
Was this dictated at a Christmas party?
Count what was <cite>considered</cite> how many times.
