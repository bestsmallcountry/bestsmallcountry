<div class="ref">
Dear Mr. 
{% include m/dan_rooney.span content="Rooney" %},
<br />
</div>

<p><em>I am no longer prepared to tolerate</em> the violation of my right 
to go about my daily business, the harassment and the 
<em>ongoing attacks on my good name</em>. 
So far this year, I have been under sustained attack 
from yourself and 
{% include m/david_sheridan.span content="David Sheridan" %} 
that is having a 
serious effect on my ability to concentrate on my work and studies, 
as a result of 
<em>entirely fictitious and unsubstantiated</em> claims made against me.
</p>

<p>For months now, I have been unable to enjoy the right to enjoy a swim 
that you claim in your <a href="/blog/2012/10/17/lcc-i1.html"> previous letter</a>, 
to confer on all your customers.  
<em>Should I fail to second guess</em> the physical movements of 
{% include m/brian_gorman.span content="any swimmer" %} however 
unpredictable, or the (mis)interpretation they may make of my swimming, 
<em>I will face accusations</em> of 
&quot;attack&quot;, 
&quot;assault" and &quot;bullying&quot; 
and all the other poison that has been under my nose since July, 
<em>and these will subsequently be counted 
as &quot;statistics&quot; to blacken my character</em>.
</p>

<p><em>Here's a statistic</em>.
I have for many years now been a regular swimmer, and had 
<em>memberships in many pools</em> around the country and beyond, and 
<em>never had a single problem</em> in any of them, except here. 
I swim in the same way in all of them, with due care and consideration 
to the wishes of other swimmers.
<em>What is going on here is deliberate, fabricated and deep in the 
gutter</em>.

<em>My friends</em> from this and other pools 
(and other acquaintances I've spoken to) 
<em>can't believe what's happening</em> to me here.
</p>

<p>I asked how you believe I should &quot;change my behaviour&quot; to use 
your terminology, which I dispute.  
<em>You have not answered, most probably because you can't</em>, 
because I go to the swimming pool to SWIM, and as rule 15 states 
(over the water fountain) &quot;Lanes are for lane swimming only&quot;.
</p>

<p><em>I'll also take this opportunity to mention a GENUINE incident</em> 
that occured twice during last year, when 
<em>I was consistantly and deliberately kicked 3-4 times every time I met 
a particular swimmer</em>.
I made NO MENTION of this until the second day (about a <em>month 
later</em>), when I began to question myself whether or not this was the 
same person as a month ago.  I made excuses for her the first day on the basis 
that there were others in the lane and she may have been trying to avoid 
oncoming swimmers, but <em>on the second occasion there were no others 
in the lane</em>, and therefore no excuse, and the contact was 
sufficiently heavy as to warrant apology.  
<em>This person was well known to pool staff 
and would be defended whatever the facts</em>.
{% include m/mary_denneny.span content="Mary Denneny" %} 
will be able to identify her. <em>The scramble to abdicate 
this swimmer of any blame contrasts starkly with the scramble to incriminate me 
with anything that can be contrived</em>.
</p>

<p>I have read your letter more than once, and I note the dates. 
I've had these <em>poisonous accusations</em> releasing their stink 
under my nose for <em>FOUR FULL MONTHS without reply</em>. 
The distress was such that after just ONE DAY I felt compelled to comment 
at the front desk.  
The only outcome (as you note) was that another opportunity was seized to catch 
onto a comment that could be subsequently used against me, as you've done. 
Four months on, <em>you have a hard neck</em> to expect a response 
within two weeks (which I'll address shortly).</p>

<p>I don't need to be reminded of the <em>date of that reply</em> 
you refer to as &quot;abrasive&quot;. 
On 23 July I'd been planning how I'd organise my day 
so as to say goodbye to my mother, Margaret, 
who died the following <a title="Mistake, it was a Saturday">Friday</a>, 28th. 
<em>My hands were shaking with rage</em> and annoyance that 
such devious <em>people could be so low and small minded and 
have nothing better to do with their time</em>. 
I noted the <em>great contrast</em> between how easily I was intercepted 
to be made aware of <em>&quot;allegations&quot;</em>, but 
I was the fastest thing on two legs that Longford ever saw 
when it might have been appropriate to intercept me to offer some 
<em>condolences.</em>.

<p>As I see things, for all the opportunities you've had, after four months, 
<em>all you</em> and David Sheridan <em>can rake up</em> on me 
are</p>
<ul>
	<li>a misinterpretation,</li>
	<li> a resolved issue, and </li>
	<li>a hate mail that couldn't possibly have been written 
	by a responsible adult in their full senses <br />
	(I counted 22 lines, 15 gramatical mistakes and 12 factuals 
	at minimum at an initial glance, not forgetting one "HA HA").</li>
</ul>

<p>I note David Sheridan's inability to look me in the eye 
since misreporting the &quot;incident&quot; involving Mr. Atkins, 
with whom I've had amicable relations since.
<em>Shame on both of you</em>.</p>

<p>The only <em>conclusion</em> I can make is that both 
<em>you and David Sheridan are fabricating</em>, are in this together, 
have contrived to cause maximum distress, and have succeeded in that goal. 
Consequently <em>neither of you are in any position to make any 
judgement</em> in relation to me.</p>

<p>I will have some reason to change this view if you outline the disciplinary 
measures you intend to take over this misreporting, and have it, along with a 
FULL APOLOGY AND WITHDRAWAL IN MY HAND 
(and not in a postbox where I no longer live) by the end of this week, 
Friday 26th.  Beyond that deadline, I will consider all options at my disposal 
including legal.  I trust this is clear and you appreciate the gravity and 
urgency of this matter.
