<p>Dear Mr. Moore,</p>

<p>Two years ago to the day, my mother passed away. 
For that reason I'll take this opportunity to remind you of my 
<a href="/blog/2012/10/20/lcc-o.html" >last correspondence to 
{% include m/dan_rooney.span content="Mr. Dan Rooney" %}</a> 
sent on 20 Oct 2014 prior to having my membership of 
{% include m/longford_sports_and_leisure.span content="Longford Swimming Pool" %} 
terminated. 
On that occasion I drew attention to the fact that 
<em><b>the first malicious accusations</b></em> were received by post 
<em><b>on the very morning I was making plans to say my final "Goodbye"</b></em> 
at the hospital.</p>

<p>In retrospect, the emotion expressed on that occasion festers no less today. 
The main difference being, that 
<em><b>
today, another entity is culpable and complicit, 
namely the 
{% include m/office_of_the_ombudsman.span content="Office of the Ombudsman," %} 
for engaging in tactics
designed to frustrate my efforts to identify fully and call to account 
those responsible. As a government entity whose envelopes bear the harp, 
your actions should have better outcomes</b></em> 
than facilitating the sneering at me, of Longford's whispering classes.</p>

<p>I refer now to 
<a href="/blog/2014/07/24/ooo-i.html" > your correspondence of 24 Jul 2014</a>, 
and would remind you that this arrived as I was preparing
to respond 
<a href="/blog/2014/07/24/ooo-i.html" > to a letter</a> on foot of 
<a href="/blog/2014/07/02/ooo-o.html" > my registered letter to 
Mr. Peter Tyndall</a> 
of 02 Jul 2014. 
<em><b>I am making the very kind assumption</b></em> 
(and this will be the last time), that this is the result of a 
<em><b>miswiring of communications.</b></em> 
From now on, I will assume that all communications are overseen 
by Mr. Tyndall personally.</p>

<p>
Your opening paragraph puts across a suggestion that you 
and your colleagues have been the reasonable party, 
and have accommodated an increasingly unreasonable me. 
To add to the date-count, which seems to be the only thing 
that receives attention, 
<mark><a title="This was by phone and was recorded in my diary">
my records show I contacted you on 19 May 2014 to establish a
reason for the silence</a></mark> to 
<a href="/blog/2014/03/23/ooo-o.html" > my letter of appeal</a> 
sent to you on 23 Mar 2014. 
<em><b>We established that I was waiting for you, and not vice-versa.</b></em>
</p>

<p>From the point of appeal, 
<em><b>the stock-take of events does not make pretty reading</b></em>. 
Of the checklist of serious and very genuine concerns raised therein, 
and in subsequent 
<ul>
	<li><a href="#">correspondence dated 29 Apr 2014</a>,</li> 
	<li><a href="/blog/2014/05/06/ooo-o.html" > 06 May 2014</a> and </li>
	<li><a href="/blog/2014/07/02/ooo-o.html" > registered on 
		02 Jun 2014</a>,</li> 
</ul>
only a handful even received lip-service. Most infuriating as been the
phony misinterpretation of 
{% include m/data_protection.span content="Data Protection" %} 
law to blanket deny me any useful information.
</p>

<p>
There are reasonable grounds for interpreting 
<a href="/blog/2014/08/18/ooo-i.html" > this latest correspondence</a> as <em><b>sinister</b/</em>. 
Notwithstanding possible extenuating circumstances that could occur at any time 
(and they did), this <em><b>ultimatum of one week</b></em> 
(minus postage time) arrived at a time of year when allowance has to be made 
for the possibility of the recipient, or their solicitor being on holiday. 
This is a serious 
<em><b>lack of decorum, unbefitting a body in a position of trust</b></em>. 
In future, whether stated or not, I will assume a minimum of 10 working days 
as a reasonable response time.
</p>

<p>Your interpretation of where matters currently stand is inaccurate. 
<em><b>The actual position can be derived 
from correspondence awaiting reply.</b></em> 
I am not responsible for the misconfiguration or incorrect implementation of
procedures at the Office of the Ombudsman that have created this vicious circle. 
<em<b>I will not be gagged</b></em> 
for the reasons outlined in earlier correspondence.
</p>

<p><em><b>Because assignment to appeal comes with this baggage, 
I cannot agree to this, and should it happen against my will, 
or without my expressed concerns addressed, 
I will not cooperate, and will seek vindication by alternative means.</b></em>
</p>
