<p>Dear Mr. Moore,</p>

<p>Two years ago to the day, my mother passed away. 
For that reason I'll take this opportunity to remind you of my 
<a href="/blog/2012/10/20/lcc-o.html" >last correspondence to 
Mr. Dan Rooney</a> sent on 20 Oct 2014 prior to having my membership 
of Longford Swimming Pool terminated. 
On that occasion I drew attention to the fact that 
<em><b>the first malicious accusations</b></em> were received by post 
<em><b>on the very morning I was making plans to say my final "Goodbye"</b></em> 
at the hospital.</p>

<p>In retrospect, the emotion expressed on that occasion festers no less today. 
The main difference being, that 
<em><b>
today, another entity is culpable and complicit, 
namely the Office of the Ombudsman, for engaging in tactics
designed to frustrate my efforts to identify fully and call to account 
those responsible. As a government entity whose envelopes bear the harp, 
your actions should have better outcomes</b></em> 
than facilitating the sneering at me, of Longford's whispering classes.</p>

<p>I refer now to 
<a href="/blog/2014/07/24/ooo-i.html" > your correspondence of 24 Jul 2014</a>, 
and would remind you that this arrived as I was preparing
to respond 
<a href="/blog/2014/07/24/ooo-i.html" > to a letter</a> on foot of 
<a href="/blog/2014/07/02/ooo-o.html" > my registered letter to 
Mr. Peter Tyndall</a> 
of 02 Jul 2014. 
<em><b>I am making the very kind assumption</b></em> 
(and this will be the last time), that this is the result of a 
<em><b>miswiring of communications.</b></em> 
From now on, I will assume that all communications are overseen 
by Mr. Tyndall personally.</p>

<p>
Your opening paragraph puts across a suggestion that you 
and your colleagues have been the reasonable party, 
and have accommodated an increasingly unreasonable me. 
To add to the date-count, which seems to be the only thing 
that receives attention, 
<mark><a title="This was by phone and was recorded in my diary">
my records show I contacted you on 19 May 2014 to establish a
reason for the silence</a></mark> to 
<a href="/blog/2014/03/23/ooo-o.html" > my letter of appeal</a> 
sent to you on 23 Mar 2014. 
<em><b>We established that I was waiting for you, and not vice-versa.</b></em>
</p>

<p>From the point of appeal, 
<em><b>the stock-take of events does not make pretty reading</b></em>. 
Of the checklist of serious and very genuine concerns raised therein, 
and in subsequent 
<ul>
	<li><a href="#">correspondence dated 29 Apr 2014</a>,</li> 
	<li><a href="/blog/2014/05/06/ooo-o.html" > 06 May 2014</a> and </li>
	<li><a href="/blog/2014/07/02/ooo-o.html" > registered on 
		02 Jun 2014</a>,</li> 
</ul>
only a handful even received lip-service. Most infuriating as been the
<em><b>phony misinterpretation of Data Protection law</b></em> 
to blanket deny me any useful information.
</p>

<p>
There are reasonable grounds for interpreting 
<a href="/blog/2014/08/18/ooo-i.html" > this latest correspondence</a> as <em><b>sinister</b/</em>. 
Notwithstanding possible extenuating circumstances that could occur at any time 
(and they did), this <em><b>ultimatum of one week</b></em> 
(minus postage time) arrived at a time of year when allowance has to be made 
for the possibility of the recipient, or their solicitor being on holiday. 
This is a serious 
<em><b>lack of decorum, unbefitting a body in a position of trust</b></em>. 
In future, whether stated or not, I will assume a minimum of 10 working days 
as a reasonable response time.
</p>

<p>Your interpretation of where matters currently stand is inaccurate. 
<em><b>The actual position can be derived 
from correspondence awaiting reply.</b></em> 
I am not responsible for the misconfiguration or incorrect implementation of
procedures at the Office of the Ombudsman that have created this vicious circle. 
<em<b>I will not be gagged</b></em> 
for the reasons outlined in earlier correspondence.
</p>

<p><em><b>Because assignment to appeal comes with this baggage, 
I cannot agree to this, and should it happen against my will, 
or without my expressed concerns addressed, 
I will not cooperate, and will seek vindication by alternative means.</b></em>
</p>
