<p>Dear 
{% include m/paddy_mahon.span content="Mr. Mahon," %}</p>

<p>I wish to make a formal complaint to the board ahead of your next meeting 
this Wednesday 16<sup>th</sup> November, regarding the mishandling of my membership.</p>

<p>I availed of the <a href="/blog/2016/10/21/billboard.html" > Special Offer</a> 
on 23<sup>rd</sup> September and was sold an annual 
membership for €237 by 
{% include m/james_obrien.span content="the manager" %} 
James O'Brien, only to be subsequently 
told that I would not be permitted to avail of it.  I insist that I be 
provided with a valid justification for this decision in writing.</p>

<br />
<img src="/images/receipts/2016-10-06-corelcheque.png" alt="Cheque for €174">
<br />

<p>Correspondence from James O'Brien dated 6<sup>th</sup> October enclosed a cheque 
for €174 (a printout of which is attached) and stated: 
<blockquote>Please find enclosed a cheque for €174. 
This is a full refund of the membership fee that was paid to 
Coral Leisure Longford on the 23<sup>rd</sup> September 2016.</blockquote>

The cheque was from "Longford Pool Construction Ltd", signed by Siobhan Tighe 
from Coral Leisure Head Office.
Please explain why money paid to Coral Leisure would be refunded by a different 
entity Longford Pool Construction Ltd., and signed by a non-employee.</p>

<p>I have enclosed an 
<a href="/blog/2014/11/06/affidavit1.html">affidavit</a>, sworn on 6<sup>th</sup> November 2014.  
This varies hugely from the false narrative and hearsay being uttered about me.
Mr. O'Brien confirmed to me that the refusal to honour my membership is a 
direct result of the comments of a legacy staff member who I have implicated.
Despite assurances to the contrary, he has not, to my knowledge conducted 
any investigation into these matters.  Please detail any investigative work 
to date and any proposals for disciplinary sanctions in relation to 
staff misconduct.</p>

<p>There has never been any evidence of any wrongdoing by me of any kind.
CCTV that would have vindicated me in relation to one supposed incident, 
was overwritten.  On that particular occasion it was I that was threatened.</p>

<p>In our supposed new age of equality, I am being absolutely discriminated 
against, for being Mel McWeeney.  Whispers behind hands have been taken 
as evidence, while the perpetrators set themselves up as arbitrators.</p>

<p>Under Freedom of Information, I am formally requesting the minutes of this
meeting as it pertains to me.  This must include a full list of attendees,
and full details of any discussions in relation to me.  The Board of 
Longford Pool Construction, individually and as a collective, have to date 
endorsed all actions against me to date.  My good name must and will be vindicated.
</p>
