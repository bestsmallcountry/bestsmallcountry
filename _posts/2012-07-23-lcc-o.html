Dear Mr. Rooney,<br />

</div>

<p>I read with disbelief and disgust 
<a href="/blog/2012/07/19/lcc-i.html" > your correspondence dated 19 July 2012</a>.  
Before going any further, I wish to point out, that like any other 
member of the public, I have my reasons for attending Longford Swimming Pool, 
and am perfectly entitled to do so in peace as a paid up member.</p>

<p>I am a very careful, considerate swimmer and am well known and liked 
among both patrons and staff.  Last Friday I pointed out a number of things 
to {% include m/david_sheridan.span content="David Sheridan" %}, 
the main one being that 
<em><b>I am entitled to use the facilities without feeling that 
spurious complaints may be made against me for no reason</b></em>, 
or my character being called into question.</p>

<p>As of yet, I have no answer to the questions I asked.
These are:</p>
<ol>
	<li><em><b>What is it exactly, that I'm supposed to 
			have done wrong?</b></em></li>
	<li>How should I &quot;change my behaviour&quot; 
			so as to avoid the reaction got?</li>
	<li>What reason is there (if any) to believe 
			that whatever happened wasn't accidental?</li>
</ol>


<p><em><b>How dare you</b></em> make assertions about me, 
that I was engaged in bullying and verbally abusive behaviour.  
If you bothered to establish facts, 
<em><b>the verbal abuse was <strong>TOWARDS</strong> me</b></em>, 
and judging by your letter, so is the bullying.
<em><b>It looks like a stitch-up.</b></em></p>

<p>I pointed out as well, that (one week later), the situation is now unfair 
to me, and shouldn't be left hanging without having these questions answered.  
<em><b>Where is my chance to respond?</b></em> Then your letter arrives.</p>

<p>Of all people, you ought to be perfectly aware of my views on the 
shortcomings of how the swimming pool is organised, an extra lane on 
this occasion may have eased &quot;congestion&quot;.
To date, you have been blatantly indifferent to feedback and suggestions, 
your responses have been insulting to my intelligence.  
With that in mind, you will also understand why 
<em><b>my tolerance towards you has a low threshold</b></em>.  
To receive such an 
<em><b>ill-informed, threatening and arrogant</b></em> 
letter before giving me any chance to respond is 
<em><b>no higher a standard than what I've come to expect</b></em>.</p>

<p>It's not as if these supposed &quot;incidents&quot; 
(trivial accidents) don't happen between swimmers every day 
of the week, including to me, and including since the complaint.  
Did I complain?  Why would I, over an accident and if I wasn't hurt?</p>

<p>I would recommend that you keep the cap on your pen until you 
<em><b>make genuine efforts to establish facts before defaming 
innocent swimmers</b></em>, going for a swim about their business.  
Current personal circumstances are such, that I would ordinarily 
leave correspondence such as this in an envelope for 24 hours before sending, 
but will forego that step on this occasion, 
as I'd be affording you a courtesy by doing so, 
that you have clearly not afforded me.</p>

<p>I demand that you <em><b>apologise</b></em> for your disgraceful 
correspondence immediately and restart your thinking giving me the 
<em><b>&quot;presumption of innocence&quot;</b></em> that I'm entitled to.</p>
