Dear Spt. Shiels,<br />
<br />
</div>

<p>
Please find enclosed a copy of <a href="/blog/2013/06/22/gda-o.html" >my 
previous correspondence</a>, <em>delivered by hand</em> on Sunday afternoon 
<a title="23rd June 2013">23rd</a> to Longford Garda Station.
I understand that the original letter was <a title="let's be kind">mislaid</a>.
</p>

<p>
Since then, while organising documents, I discovered that the membership I held 
was a six month student membership, purchased on October 5<sup>th</sup> 2012 for €140.
This is <a title="As of 01 Jul 2013">still</a> the price quoted on 
<a href="http://longfordsportsandleisure.ie/rates.htm">longfordsportsandleisure.com/rates.htm</a>.

You will see from the dates that I was only allowed to avail of half of this membership.
As the Terms and Conditions of membership contain no facility for a compliant member 
to have a membership terminated in such a manner as mine was, 
I consider myself to be the victim of theft.
</p>

<p>
The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act at
<a href="http://irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0050/sec0006.html" >
irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0050/sec0006.html</a>, defines theft as
<cite>
6.—(1) A person who dishonestly, with the intention of making a gain 
for himself or herself or another, or of causing loss to another, 
by any deception induces another to do or refrain from doing an act 
is guilty of an offence.
</cite>
<a title="(2) A person guilty of an offence under this section 
is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment 
for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.">
A loss has been caused to me of three months of membership.  I want this reinstated.
</a>
</p>

<p>
The primary issues here are about my civil rights to lawfully go about my day, 
and the right to my good name which has been damaged.

As a result, I would not accept a cash payment in lieu of lost membership 
as a settlement, and wish to press charges against Mr. 
{% include m/dan_rooney.span content="Dan Rooney" %} 
and his facilitators for theft.  I would appreciate your feedback and advice.
