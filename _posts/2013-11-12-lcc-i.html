<p>Dear Mr. McWeeney,</p>


<p>
{% include m/francis_sheridan.span content="I" %} 
refer to <a href="/blog/2013/03/28/lcc-o.html" >
your correspondence to me</a> of 28<sup>th</sup> March 2013 and 
<a href="/blog/2013/04/11/lcc-i.html">my letter of response</a> to you on 11<sup>th</sup> April 2013 
in which I stated that I had forwarded 
<a href="/blog/2013/03/28/lcc-o.html" > your letter of complaint</a> 
to the Council's legal advisor for his opinion.  
On receipt of that opinion I undertook to further communicate with you.</p>

<p>Having reviewed <a href="/blog/2013/01/04/lcc-i.html">the decision</a> 
on your suspension and <em>having approved of the decision</em> that was reached 
following a <a title="lies">process which you were informed of at each step</a>, 
I should have informed you that 
<em>I did not consider your letter of complaint as justified and that 
I was not prepared to engage in further correspondence with you on the matter.</em>
</p>

<p>I wish to apologise that I did not communicate with you in a 
timely manner as promised and as indicated above.</p>
