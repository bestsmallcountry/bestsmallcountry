<p>Dear 
{% include m/willie_odowd.span content="Mr. O'Dowd," %}</p>

<p>
I received yesterday an acknowledgement to my Freedom of Information request of 3rd October
2017. I refer specifically to item "2: eMail archive". I have been requested to email
foi@longfordcoco.ie but the practicalities are problematic.</p>

<p>
I have asserted in my request as follows in 2(a) which lead to the scenarios outlined thereafter:
</p>

<blockquote>
I also require a full archive of all emails received from me to addresses @longfordcoco.ie which
can be sent to me electronically. No delivery failures to any of these addresses were ever
received, nor, despite having been requested, was any confirmation of delivery. The natural
conclusion here is that they were deliberately quarantined, and that's where the search for them
can be focused.
</blockquote>

<p>
Scenario 1: I've NOT been removed from a blacklist.
</p>

<p>
If correct, then an email to foi@, as to any other address @longfordcoco.ie would not be received.
This could be misconstrued as meaning I've failed to facilitate retrieval of the requested archive.
</p>

<p>
Scenario 2: I HAVE been removed from a blacklist.
</p>

<p>
This could only occur if my email address is already known, and if so, should not have been asked
for. The only way I could email as requested would be if the address has been temporarily
removed from the blacklist to allow an email to foi@ to be received. This would facilitate a further
false narrative in regard to the blacklist into the future.
</p>

<p>
I would suggest that it be passed on to your I.T. department that my email address contains my
surname without spaces. This is not a common surname, so it could easily be searched for. How
vast could this list possibly be?
</p>

<p>
Had I been a "Murphy" as per your letter of 09th October 2017, then a search might been
somewhat more complicated, but manageable nevertheless.
</p>

<p>
For all of the above reasons, section 2(a) of my request stands unaltered, and I expect full
compliance along with all the other points raised without any further intervention on my part.
