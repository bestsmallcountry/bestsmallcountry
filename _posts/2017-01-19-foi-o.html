<p>Hi Ciara,</p>

<p>
I have received what looks like a <a href="/blog/2017/01/17/lcc-i.html" >standard 
letter</a> acknowledging receipt of my Freedom of Information request 
from Longford Co. Council.
</p>

<p> 
However, they claim to have received this on <em>16th January 2017</em>, 
and allocated it a corresponding reference number 17 (11) LCC.
</p>

<p>
The council's acknowledgment states that I am 
<blockquote>entitled to appeal... within 4 weeks</blockquote>
which I am not interested in doing, 
given their contempt for me, and for the law, 
which requires acknowledgement within two weeks (10 working days) 
and reply within four weeks (twenty working days).
</p>

<p>
Four weeks means <cite>four weeks</cite>, 
<em>not</em> <cite>four weeks unless someone is out sick</cite>, 
<em>not</em> <cite>four weeks unless you're busy</cite> and 
<em>not</em> <cite>four weeks unless Christmas is coming</cite>, 
so they are already in breach and have broken the law 
as things presently stand.
</p>

<p>
I recently visited the site of the Information Commissioner, 
and downloaded and read the most relevant sections of the 2014 Act.
I would very much appreciate any possible advice or referral 
you could give with the goal of prosecution and/or sanction 
against the non-responders. 

<p>
I will be advised by my solicitor when I have 
all possible relevant materials in advance.
