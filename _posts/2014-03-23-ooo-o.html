<p>Further to my earlier correspondence, I've been reviewing the accumulated 
documentation to date related to the case.  In particular <em><b>I've been 
reviewing the &quot;Complaint Examination Process&quot;</b></em> emailed to me by Deirdre 
Morgan on 09 Jan 2014 in an attempt to make sense of my dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>I'd noted that <em><cite>it may be necessary to get further information... or meet 
with officials or others</cite></em>, and had a genuine expectation that this would 
happen, and had <em><b>expected that to be my opportunity to give my side of events 
to impartial ears, but this never happened.</b></em></p>

<p>At the very outset, I wrote a 
<a href="/blog/2013/03/28/lcc-o.html" > formal complaint to Mr. Francis Sheridan</a> 
(Longford County Council), about Mr. Dan Rooney (Longford Town Council) 
about my treatment by &quot;a company&quot; owned by both Councils 
jointly. 
I believe I had a reasonable expectation that this Office would first and 
foremost, establish the exact entity or entities my complaint is against.  
This MUST now happen.  Insufficient attention was given to the fact that 
<em><b>the Councils lied</b></em> in this regard, <em>claiming their company was 
independent, and therefore beyond the remit of this Office.</em></p>

<p><em>In the absense of such concrete information</em>, it is difficult 
to <em>impossible for me to determine what information is 
&quot;relevant&quot;.  I need to know exactly, who future &quot;Freedom of 
Information&quot; requests should be directed to</em>, and/or <em>who any 
legal action should be taken against</em>.  I also <em>need to know</em> 
what the legal position is</em>, for example, <em>when someone defames on 
Council time, or gets paid legal advice at the taxpayers expense</em>.
<br />
<em><b>Is this misconduct the act of maverick individuals acting in isolation, or 
is it systemic, and if so, systemic to which entity?</b></em>

<p>Regarding the Examination, I did the work, I provided the questions, 
<em><b>I wrote a formal complaint to Mr. Francis Sheridan.  He should have 
been made to answer each and every one of those specific questions, and 
not given the scope to fudge.</b></em>  I should have been informed of what 
questions had been asked, and his answers to each in response, and asked 
for my thoughts subsequently.  <em><b>This case is now at Appeal stage 
and I have had NOT ONE answer.</b></em></p>

<p><em><b>The &quot;Complaint Examination Process&quot; also led me to believe 
that I could contact my case worker at any time</b></em>, yet in the days 
leading up to the decision, I was told that <em><b>no extra information 
would be considered<b></em>.  I felt totally frustrated because <em><b>
I had no 
indication of the report's content, or what I needed to rebut</b></em>.  
I had noted from earlier documents received under FOI, that <b>the 
<em>Councils were prepared to dig into any depth of history to spin, 
distort and intimidate</em>.</b></p>
</p>
<p>On 10 March 2014, I received correspondence from Derek Charles 
(Ref: FOI/2014/0114) to the effect that <em><b>this same report was 
excempt from FOI</b></em>.  Assuming this to be the case, I believe 
<em><b>I should have been provided with what I'm accused of</b></em> 
in any case for the reasons already outlined.  Considering that <em><b>
what I've already submitted has been largely disregarded</b></em>, 
<em><b>I am reluctant to invest further time</b></em> in adding context to 
earlier submissions <em><b>until I am satisfied that I'm finally being afforded due 
attention</b><em>.</p>

<p>My primary grounds for this Appeal are </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>(2:)</b> failure to appreciate the position in which I found 
	myself, when being <em><b>asked to legitimise the arbitration 
	of the very fabricators</b></em></li>
	<li><b>(3:)</b> failure to request CCTV footage</li>
	<li><b>(4:)</b> failure to adequately consider the possibility 
	that <em><b>the Council's position is not simply incorrect, but 
	deliberately contrived</b></em> which meant that </li>
	<li><b>(5:)</b> the complaint was not properly understood.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p><em><b>As I understand the function of the Office of the Ombudsman, 
it is a mechanism for ordinary citizens such as me</b></em>, 
without legal training, who are mistreated by publicly funded bodies, 
<em><b>to seek redress</b></em>.  
To date, <em><b>as a consumer</b></em> of this service, 
<em><b>I struggle to understand how the simplest and most clear 
abuse of public office can go the entire distance to Appeal without 
even one answer provided to me</b></em>, and all my time and energy 
seems to be spent on preventing my case from being closed and disgarded. 
<em><b>A commitment to an oral hearing would greatly help</b></em> 
in this regard.  My experience to date has been that 
<em><b>this Office does not provide the functionality it purports to 
provide</b></em> , but I attribute this to oversight, and hope it can 
now be addressed.</b></em></p>.
