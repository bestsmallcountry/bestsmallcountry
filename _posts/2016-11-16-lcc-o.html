<p>Hi John
{% include m/john_browne.span content="John," %}
{% include m/gerry_warnock.span content="(please pass on to Gerry)" %}</p>
<p>I did a scan and found your email address, but couldn't find one for Gerry.</p>
<p>In any case please share this with him before or during tonight's meeting.</p>
<p>As I said in my voice messages, <em>it's taken four years to ask these questions.</em></p>
<p>In particular I want to know <em>who attended</em> the meeting where I was voted out.</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance</p>
