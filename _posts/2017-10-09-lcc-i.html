<h2><u>Freedom of Information Request Reference Number 17(82)LCC</u></h2>

<p>Dear Mr <a title="Who?"><mark>Murphy</mark></a></p>

<p>
{% include m/willie_odowd.span content="I" %}
wish to acknowledge receipt of your
<a href="/blog/2017/10/03/lcc-o.html">Freedom of Information request</a>
received by this office on the 3<sup>rd</sup> October, 2017
copy of which is enclosed for your information.
I would be grateful if you could send an email to foi@longfordcoco.ie
so that we can match up your email address with our archives.
</p>

<p>
A decision on your request will normally be sent to you within 4 weeks
(20 working days) of receipt of your request which means you can expect
to receive your decision by the 30<sup>th</sup> October 2017.
</p>

<p>
If you have not received your decision by the expiry of the allotted time 
you are entitled to appeal to Longford County Council for a review of the 
matter based on the premise that the initial request is considered to be 
refused once the specified time for responding to it has expired. 
The review will be a new examination of the matter carried out by a more 
senior member of staff of the Council. 
In the event that you need to make such an appeal you can do so in writing 
within 4 weeks (after the date given for the initial decision) to the 
Senior Executive Officer, Human Resources, Longford County Council, 
Aras an Chontae, Gt. Water St., Longford. 
You should state that you are appealing because an initial decision was not 
received by you within the time permitted.
