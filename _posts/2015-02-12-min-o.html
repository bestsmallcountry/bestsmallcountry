<p>Dear Minister Kelly,</p>

<p>I wish to register a formal complaint of 
<em><b>Misconduct in Public Office</b></em> against the Ombudsman, 
{% include m/peter_tyndall.span content="Mr. Peter Tyndall," %}  
for the <em><b>mismanagement</b></em> of my case 
(reference as above) which <em><b>happened on his watch</b></em>, 
and against the <em><b>Longford public figures</b></em> 
{% include m/peggy_nolan.span content="whose" %} 
{% include m/padraig_loughrey.span content="identity" %}
{% include m/john_browne.span content="his" %}
{% include m/gerry_warnock.span content="mismanagement" %}
{% include m/paddy_mahon.span content="has" %} 
<em><b>deliberately concealed</b></em> 
from me.</p>

<p><em><b>I consider the 
{% include m/office_of_the_ombudsman.span content="Ombudsman" %}
complicit in my grievance by Dereliction of Duty.</b></em></p>

<p>Until my experiences during 2014, I had believed the dictionary definition
 of the word <cite><b>&quot;Ombudaman&quot;:</b> (noun)
'official who investigates complaints against government organisations' 
(Collins -Gem).</cite></p>

<p>In Ireland today, this
definition does not apply. <em><b>I had expected assistance</b></em> 
in establishing facts that I'd otherwise be denied.
Instead, I found an office with a predisposition to achieve a particular finding, 
regardless of the facts.</p>

<p>It should have been <em><b>perfectly obvious</b></em> to any impartial observer, 
from the documentation supplied in 2013, that 
<em><b>I was completely stitched up.</b></em>  
This was perpetrated <em><b>by malicious liars</b></em> who knew that denying me 
my daily swim, would hurt me much more than simply organising a gang of thugs 
at a street cornor, so they did just that.</p>

<p>Over the course of the <em>&quot;investigation&quot;</em>, in particular 
when at appeal stage, 
<em><b>the Office of the Ombudsman</b></em> effectively <em><b>joined the ranks of the 
perpetrators.</b></em></p>

<p>This arose when a nefarious decision was taken by the board of 
Longford Sports and Leisure, who ran pool
affairs on behalf of the (then) two shareholders, 
{% include m/longford_town_council.span content="Longford Town Council" %} 
and 
{% include m/longford_county_council.span content="Longford County Council." %} 
This board is predominantly made up of sitting councillors, many of whom still 
hold office. The result of their malevolent decision is that 
<em><b>Longford assumes I must have done something wrong, 
because these things don't &quot;just happen&quot;.</b></em> 
They did, they do, and there's no end in sight.
<em><b>My good name has been slurred by the 
<a href="/blog/2012/10/17/lcc-i2.html">false narrative</a></b></em> 
that this malicious decision has perpetuated, and I insist that this narrative 
be corrected.</p>

<p>Insofar as I can summarise, the then 
{% include m/david_sheridan.span content="pool manager," %} 
for reasons best known to himself, organised for a 
<a title="I could name the person here but I'll be kind"><i>friend</i></a>
to kick me repeatedly, then distorted or invented "incidents", and 
recruited 
{% include m/brian_gorman.span content="people" %} 
to make complaints.</p>

<p>Of the <em><b>three complaints</b></em> received, one was from a man who 
physically threatened 

<a title="AFAIK he arrived about half a year earlier 
and hadn't mastered the etiquette"><i>not just me</i></a>, 
but others, and had disputes with many. However, in my case, 
<em><b>I was to blame for the threat that I RECEIVED!!</b></em> 
As far as I've been able to establish, the <em><b>second</b></em> complaint 
came from the <em><b>Mammy</b></em> of one of Longford's County Councillors, 
while the <em><b>third</b></em> was an <a href="/blog/2012/10/17/LCC-i2.html">email</a> that 
<ol>
	<li>smelt strongly of alcohol, and</li>
	<li>had a "re:" at the start of the subject line</li>
</ol>
leading me to conclude it was induced.</p>

<p>On 04 Jan 2013, by redirected post, I received 
<a href="/blog/2013/01/04/lcc-i.html">correspondence</a> with my 
<em><b>correct address on the letter</b></em>, but my
<em><b>previous address on the envelope</b></em>. 
Given the timing, I have to wonder was it toasted at a Christmas Party
(which would also explain the address anomoly).</p>

<p>It can be paraphrased as follows:
<ul> We considered the complaints made about you.
	<li>We considered what you had to say.</li>
	<li>And we considered the complaints made about you, you're barred.</li>
</ul>
Did something happen twice just then?</p>

<p><a title="I had exams to get through, among other things">
<i>Given personal circumstances at the time</i></a>, 
it wasn't until late March 2013 
when I was in a position to try and establish who was behind this, 
and went to the public park "The Mall" where the Sports Complex is located, 
in the hope of meeting people I knew.</p>

<p>After almost two hours of waiting on a public seat, eventually two such
people spoke to me. Within less than twenty minutes, a <em><b>squad car</b></em> 
had been <em><b>&quot;ordered&quot;</b></em> (literally) by the culpable 
public official, with the ease that an ordinary citizen would order Pizza.</p>

<p>What subsequently transpired is 
with Minister Frances Fitzgerald 
awaiting review (Ref: 4/500/1/238).</p>

<p>All of this was clearly communicated to the Ombudsman's staff in a timely 
manner. However, none of it had any bearing on the eventual outcome.</p>

<p>The frustrations and highlights of the appeal process have been
failure to appropriately allocate <em>&quot;credibility&quot; points</em> 
when it transpired that:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Initial <em><b>pre-appeal contacts to Longford Co. Co. 
		were ignored</b></em>.</li>
	<li><em><b>Despite claims</b></em> to the contrary, 
		the facility was NOT run by an &quot;independent company&quot;, 
		and <em><b>I provided proof</b></em> of this.</li>
	<li>No &quot;due process&quot; for dealing with complaints was ever in place, 
		so by deduction none was followed.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><em><b>The crux</b></em> of the issue has always been that 
the very <em><b>perpetrators</b></em> of the fabrication had 
<em><b>appointed themselves as arbitrators</b></em>.
</p>

<p>This was not considered a factor, as the initial finding against me stated. 
I was flabbergasted.  The only conclusion I can come to is that 
<em><b>the process was rigged</b></em>, and for that reason I made a formal
complaint against <em><b>my case worker</b></em> who had reached that finding. 
Of course, he was subsequently <em><b>exonerated</b></em>.</p>

<p>
<em><b>At appeal stage</b></em>, the situation deteriorated to the point where 
<em><b>I wondered if the Office of the Ombudsman can
investigate complaints against themselves</b></em>.</p>
<p><b>They received <em>&quot;a very detailed report&quot;</em></b>, 
presumably (but they didn't clearly state) from Longford Co. Co. 
From that point until they eventually closed the case, they steadfastly 
<em><b>refused to give me any idea</b></em> of
<ul>
	<li>what the report alleged,</li>
	<li>what entity submitted it, or</li>
	<li>on what entity's behalf.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><em><b>Therefore</b></em> I have no way of knowing whether I'm dealing with 
maverick individuals who happen to be councillors, or one or the other or both 
of the then councils. This means that <em><b>I don't yet know
the identity of legal entities who defamed me</b></em> by their behaviour, 
and against whom I should take legal action.</p>

<p>More immediately, <em><b>not being aware of the report's contents, 
I had no idea how I should set about rebuttal.  
This would have been a lesser problem if I'd actually done something wrong that 
I might remember</b></em>.</p> 

<p>I was first <em><b><refused under Freedom of Information</b></em>. 
Because "information" by definition is true, 
I <em><b>then</b></em> attempted to have the misinformation corrected 
via <em><b>Data Protection</b></em>.

The reason they <em><b>refused</b></em> made no sense to me, 
so I can't paraphrase it for you. 
The 
{% include m/data_protection.span content="Data Protection" %} 
Commissioner was of no help either.</p>

<p>Without clarity as to what I was to rebut, 
<em><b>I refused to consent to appeal proceeding, and made it clear</b></em>
that any appeal without my rebuttal would not be done with my 
permission, approval, engagement or co-operation.</p>

<p>At the height of the 2014 holiday season, I was notified that I was to respond 
to correspondence sent, <em>within SEVEN working days</em>, 
otherwise the appeal would go ahead. 
I urge you to retrieve this correspondence.</p>

<p>At this point, I was under no illusion that 
the <em><b>Office of the Ombudsman was a participant</b></em> in the conspiracy, 
and by way of contingency, made 
contact with the Minister for Justice 
so that this case will be considered during the Judicial Reviews.</p>

<p><em><b>Predictably, the Ombudsman assigned the case</b></em> 
for appeal, without my consent, without my rebuttal, and
<em><b>without once engaging with me</b></em> verbally to establish facts. 
The outcome was no surprise.</p>

<p>On being officially notified, I noted the overtone that 
I was expected to be deeply dissatisfied, which obviously I was. 
Much more significant to me though, was the fact that 
<em><b>the Office of the Ombudsman</b></em> is an quasi-judicial organ of
the Irish Government, whose <em><b>envelopes bear the harp</b></em>.</p>

<p>Receiving any conclusion, finding or otherwise in such an envelope, is the 
Irish State, affirming to me, that 
<em><b>what happened to me has the endorsement of the State</b></em> 
and is legal, lawful and justified. 
<em><b>My VINDICATION must come in an envelope with a harp</b></em>, 
ideally with a profuse apology from those miscreants, living off the public purse, 
who have shown this citizen complete contempt.</p>

<p>Should any doubt remain regarding conflicting versions of events, please find enclosed my affidavit and
attachments. I look forward to a timely and satisfactory resolution.</p>
