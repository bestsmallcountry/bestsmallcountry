Dear Minister Kelly,

</div>

<p>I wish to register a formal complaint of 
<em><b>Misconduct in Public Office</b></em> against the Ombudsman, 
Mr. Peter Tyndall, for the <em><b>mismanagement</b></em> of my case 
(reference as above) which <em><b>happened on his watch</b></em>, 
and against the <em><b>Longford public figures</b></em> 
whose identity his mismanagement has <em><b>deliberately concealed</b></em> 
from me.</p>

<p><em><b>I consider the Ombudsman complicit in my grievance by 
Dereliction of Duty.</b></em></p>

<p>Until my experiences during 2014, I had believed the dictionary definition
 of the word <cite><b>&quot;Ombudaman&quot;:</b> (noun)
'official who investigates complaints against government organisations' 
(Collins -Gem).</cite></p>

<p>In Ireland today, this
definition does not apply. <em><b>I had expected assistance</b></em> 
in establishing facts that I'd otherwise be denied.
Instead, I found an office with a predisposition to achieve a particular finding, 
regardless of the facts.</p>

<p>It should have been <em><b>perfectly obvious</b></em> to any impartial observer, 
from the documentation supplied in 2013, that 
<em><b>I was completely stitched up.</b></em>  
This was perpetrated <em><b>by malicious liars</b></em> who knew that denying me 
my daily swim, would hurt me much more than simply organising a gang of thugs 
at a street cornor, so they did just that.</p>

<p>Over the course of the <em>&quot;investigation&quot;</em>, in particular 
when at appeal stage, 
<em><b>the Office of the Ombudsman</b></em> effectively <em><b>joined the ranks of the 
perpetrators.</b></em></p>

<p>This arose when a nefarious decision was taken by the board of 
Longford Sports and Leisure, who ran pool
affairs on behalf of the (then) two shareholders, 
Longford Town Council and Longford County Council. 
This board is predominantly made up of sitting councillors, many of whom still 
hold office. The result of their malevolent decision is that 
<em><b>Longford assumes I must have done something wrong, 
because these things don't &quot;just happen&quot;.</b></em> 
They did, they do, and there's no end in sight.
<em><b>My good name has been slurred by the 
<a href="/blog/2012/10/17/lcc-i2.html">false narrative</a></b></em> 
that this malicious decision has perpetuated, and I insist that this narrative 
be corrected.</p>

<p>Insofar as I can summarise, the then pool manager, 
for reasons best known to himself, organised for a 
<a title="I could name the person here but I'll be kind"><i>friend</i></a>
to kick me repeatedly, then distorted or invented "incidents", and 
recruited people to make complaints.</p>

<p>Of the <em><b>three complaints</b></em> received, one was from a man who 
physically threatened 

<a title="AFAIK he arrived about half a year earlier 
and hadn't mastered the etiquette"><i>not just me</i></a>, 
but others, and had disputes with many. However, in my case, 
<em><b>I was to blame for the threat that I RECEIVED!!</b></em> 
As far as I've been able to establish, the <em><b>second</b></em> complaint 
came from the <em><b>Mammy</b></em> of one of Longford's County Councillors, 
while the <em><b>third</b></em> was an <a href="/blog/2012/10/17/LCC-i2.html">email</a> that 
<ol>
	<li>smelt strongly of alcohol, and</li>
	<li>had a "re:" at the start of the subject line</li>
</ol>
leading me to conclude it was induced.</p>

<p>On 04 Jan 2013, by redirected post, I received 
<a href="/blog/2013/01/04/lcc-i.html">correspondence</a> with my 
<em><b>correct address on the letter</b></em>, but my
<em><b>previous address on the envelope</b></em>. 
Given the timing, I have to wonder was it toasted at a Christmas Party
(which would also explain the address anomoly).</p>

<p>It can be paraphrased as follows:
<ul> We considered the complaints made about you.
	<li>We considered what you had to say.</li>
	<li>And we considered the complaints made about you, you're barred.</li>
</ul>
Did something happen twice just then?</p>

<p><a title="I had exams to get through, among other things">
<i>Given personal circumstances at the time</i></a>, 
it wasn't until late March 2013 
when I was in a position to try and establish who was behind this, 
and went to the public park "The Mall" where the Sports Complex is located, 
in the hope of meeting people I knew.</p>

<p>After almost two hours of waiting on a public seat, eventually two such
people spoke to me. Within less than twenty minutes, a <em><b>squad car</b></em> 
had been <em><b>&quot;ordered&quot;</b></em> (literally) by the culpable 
public official, with the ease that an ordinary citizen would order Pizza.</p>

<p>What subsequently transpired is 
with Minister Frances Fitzgerald 
awaiting review (Ref: 4/500/1/238).</p>

<p>All of this was clearly communicated to the Ombudsman's staff in a timely 
manner. However, none of it had any bearing on the eventual outcome.</p>

<p>The frustrations and highlights of the appeal process have been
failure to appropriately allocate <em>&quot;credibility&quot; points</em> 
when it transpired that:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Initial <em><b>pre-appeal contacts to Longford Co. Co. 
		were ignored</b></em>.</li>
	<li><em><b>Despite claims</b></em> to the contrary, 
		the facility was NOT run by an &quot;independent company&quot;, 
		and <em><b>I provided proof</b></em> of this.</li>
	<li>No &quot;due process&quot; for dealing with complaints was ever in place, 
		so by deduction none was followed.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><em><b>The crux</b></em> of the issue has always been that 
the very <em><b>perpetrators</b></em> of the fabrication had 
<em><b>appointed themselves as arbitrators</b></em>.
</p>

<p>This was not considered a factor, as the initial finding against me stated. 
I was flabbergasted.  The only conclusion I can come to is that 
<em><b>the process was rigged</b></em>, and for that reason I made a formal
complaint against <em><b>my case worker</b></em> who had reached that finding. 
Of course, he was subsequently <em><b>exonerated</b></em>.</p>

<p>
<em><b>At appeal stage</b></em>, the situation deteriorated to the point where 
<em><b>I wondered if the Office of the Ombudsman can
investigate complaints against themselves</b></em>.</p>
<p><b>They received <em>&quot;a very detailed report&quot;</em></b>, 
presumably (but they didn't clearly state) from Longford Co. Co. 
From that point until they eventually closed the case, they steadfastly 
<em><b>refused to give me any idea</b></em> of
<ul>
	<li>what the report alleged,</li>
	<li>what entity submitted it, or</li>
	<li>on what entity's behalf.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><em><b>Therefore</b></em> I have no way of knowing whether I'm dealing with 
maverick individuals who happen to be councillors, or one or the other or both 
of the then councils. This means that <em><b>I don't yet know
the identity of legal entities who defamed me</b></em> by their behaviour, 
and against whom I should take legal action.</p>

<p>More immediately, <em><b>not being aware of the report's contents, 
I had no idea how I should set about rebuttal.  
This would have been a lesser problem if I'd actually done something wrong that 
I might remember</b></em>.</p> 

<p>I was first <em><b><refused under Freedom of Information</b></em>. 
Because "information" by definition is true, 
I <em><b>then</b></em> attempted to have the misinformation corrected 
via <em><b>Data Protection</b></em>.

The reason they <em><b>refused</b></em> made no sense to me, 
so I can't paraphrase it for you. 
The Data Protection Commissioner was of no help either.</p>

<p>Without clarity as to what I was to rebut, 
<em><b>I refused to consent to appeal proceeding, and made it clear</b></em>
that any appeal without my rebuttal would not be done with my 
permission, approval, engagement or co-operation.</p>

<p>At the height of the 2014 holiday season, I was notified that I was to respond 
to correspondence sent, <em>within SEVEN working days</em>, 
otherwise the appeal would go ahead. 
I urge you to retrieve this correspondence.</p>

<p>At this point, I was under no illusion that 
the <em><b>Office of the Ombudsman was a participant</b></em> in the conspiracy, 
and by way of contingency, made 
contact with the Minister for Justice 
so that this case will be considered during the Judicial Reviews.</p>

<p><em><b>Predictably, the Ombudsman assigned the case</b></em> 
for appeal, without my consent, without my rebuttal, and
<em><b>without once engaging with me</b></em> verbally to establish facts. 
The outcome was no surprise.</p>

<p>On being officially notified, I noted the overtone that 
I was expected to be deeply dissatisfied, which obviously I was. 
Much more significant to me though, was the fact that 
<em><b>the Office of the Ombudsman</b></em> is an quasi-judicial organ of
the Irish Government, whose <em><b>envelopes bear the harp</b></em>.</p>

<p>Receiving any conclusion, finding or otherwise in such an envelope, is the 
Irish State, affirming to me, that 
<em><b>what happened to me has the endorsement of the State</b></em> 
and is legal, lawful and justified. 
<em><b>My VINDICATION must come in an envelope with a harp</b></em>, 
ideally with a profuse apology from those miscreants, living off the public purse, 
who have shown this citizen complete contempt.</p>

<p>Should any doubt remain regarding conflicting versions of events, please find enclosed my affidavit and
attachments. I look forward to a timely and satisfactory resolution.</p>

Yours sincerely
