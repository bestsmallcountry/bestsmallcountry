<p>Dear Mr. McWeeney,</p>

<p>
I have been asked by Mr. Alan Kelly, Minister for the Environment,
Community and Local Government, to acknowledge receipt of your 
<a href="/blog/2015/02/12/min-o.html">recent letter</a> 
in connection with a formal complaint of Misconduct against the 
{% include m/peter_tyndall.span content="Ombudsman." %}
</p>

<p>
I can assure you that your correspondence has been examined 
in full detail and this matter has received thorough attention
by the department.
<em>However, as this matter has been brought to the attention of, 
and examined by the office of the Ombudsman,
the Minister is precluded from intervening.</em>
</p>

<p>
If you are dissatisfied with the level of service provided by the 
office of the Ombudsman,
and you still consider that you have been adversely affected
by said office's action, or lack of action,
which you consider unfair or unreasonable,
it is open to you to make a complaint to the European Ombudsman.
</p>
