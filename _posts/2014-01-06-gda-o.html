<p>Dear Commissioner Callinan,</p>
<p>
I was the victim of a malevolent complaint made by Mr. 
{% include m/dan_rooney.span content="Dan Rooney" %}, Longford Town Clerk to Longford
Gardai on 25th March 2013. The purpose of the complaint was to frustrate any efforts I might make to
establish facts related to his suspension of my pool membership. 
The 
{% include m/office_of_the_ombudsman.span content="Office of the Ombudsman" %} 
are presently investigating. I expect they will find that 
I have indeed done nothing wrong and have been deliberately targeted and victimised.
</p>
<p>
In the archive I've included, are copies of my efforts to date, to establish the nature of the complaint and the
bounds of the restriction, from Superintendent Denis Shiels, of whom I'm now complaining. I am turning to
you now, because all my efforts to date have been unsuccessful.
</p>
<p>
<em>Key dates in 2013</em>
<ul>
<li><em>14 Jan -</em>Visited by Community Policing, Sgt. Ursula Hussey, Ken Doogan and Michael Belton.</li>
<li><em>23 Jun -</em>Spoke to Sgt. Loughrey who explained procedure of establishing the nature of a complaint.</li>
Delivered first request to Longford Gardai (possibly to same Garda who attended The Mall).</li>
<li><em>01 Jul -</em>Delivered copy of both requests to Annemarie Reilly who can be relied on to pass messages.</li>
<li><em>08 Jul -</em>Rang Superintendent's office and spoke to David who confirmed receipt of correspondence.</li>
<li><em>24 Jul -</em>Met with Supt., who only repeated Mr. Rooney's "complaints about your behaviour" comments.</li>
<li><em>22 Aug -</em>Called and spoke to Annmarie Reilly who emailed Sgt. Ursula Hussey to contact me.</li>
<li><em>24 Aug -</em>Initial contact from the Office of the Ombudsman, from Brian McKeon.</li>
<li><em>05 Dec -</em><a href="/blog/2013/12/05/gda-i.html" >Response from Fran Nicholson</a> 
		of Longford Gardai (Inspector for Superintendent).</li>
<li><em>19 Dec -</em>Assignment of a case worker, Deirdre Morgan, from the Office of the Ombudsman.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This is the first occasion that I've had any experience of a Garda acting contrary to the Garda Charter.
Judging by the tone used during that meeting, and the 
		<a href="/blog/2013/12/05/gda-i.html" >letter of 05 Dec 2013</a>, 
		I very much doubt that my
appreciation was passed on (as requested) to Community Policing. During that meeting, Supt. Shiels was
very dismissive, and read correspondence selectively. I left without answers and was told 
&quot;No more letters&quot;.</p>
<p>
I'd been trying to contact Sgt. Ursula Hussey specifically because having seen the state of upset I was in
when visited by Community Policing, she might have better luck getting answers. The fact that she did not
make contact raises my concerns that she may have been instructed not to. I also tried a personal friend
who is a Sergeant at another station. He knew the Superintendent and we spoke confidentially, but that
came to nothing either.
</p>
<p>
I understand that Supt. Shiels has recently retired, and for this reason I'm addressing you as opposed to the
Garda Ombudsman Commission. As a jobseeker, <a title="I was">I need to know that I would not be refused Garda or
Security Clearance</a>. In any case, I need my good name reinstated.
Having heard you speak on television recently, I believe that the standards you expect from the force, are
those that I've experienced until now, and that the uniform is not given to protect misbehaving public figures.
I hope you'll agree that the innocent victim of a malevolent complaint should not be addressed in the tone
used with me, and corrective action can be taken.
</p>
