<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>

<p>
On three occasions already, I have attempted to ascertain the basis upon which 
Longford County Council 
<a href="/blog/2013/01/04/lcc-i.html" > prohibit me</a> 
from use of their public sports facilities.  
The <a href="/blog/2016/11/14/lcc-o.html"> most recent of these attempts</a> 
was delivered by hand on 14<sup>th</sup> November 2016 
for the attention of the County Manager, Mr. Paddy Mahon, and I received 
a stamped receipt of delivery.
</p>

From Mel McWeeney, Re: Longford Pool Const.">

<p>
The facility itself trades as <cite>Longford Sports and Leisure Centre</cite> 
and is <a href="http://longford.coralleisure.ie/" >linked to</a> under 
<cite>Information and Services</cite> from the 
<a href="http://longfordcoco.ie/" >Council's home page</a>, and although run on the Council’s behalf 
by <a href="http://coralleisure.ie/" >Coral Leisure</a>, the actual legal entity 
that operates the facility is <em>Longford Pool Construction Ltd.</em>
</p>

<p>
Longford Pool Construction Ltd. had, at the time I last checked, two shares. 
One was held by Longford County Council, and the other by Longford Town Council. 
Since the abolition of Town Councils countrywide, I have not rechecked, but 
would expect that the Town Council’s shareholding was usurped by Longford County Council.
</p>

<p>
My previous attempts to establish the basis for my exclusion were in FOI requests 
addressed to Mary Morrissey, Longford Co. Council’s Freedom of Information Officer.
</p>

<p>
The first of these was sent on <a href="/blog/2013/06/04/lcc-o.html" >04<sup>th</sup> June 2013</a>.  
This was acknowledged on <a href="/blog/2013/06/10/lcc-i.html" >10<sup>th</sup> June 2013</a>, 
and responded to on <a href="/blog/2013/06/28/lcc-i.html" >28th June 2013</a>.
This resulted in me being provided with a fraction 
of correspondence that I already had, and consequently 
I was unwilling to part with an additional <cite>standard fee of €75</cite> 
for an <cite>internal review under Section 14</cite>, 
which would involve a reconsideration by a more senior bully.
</p>

<p>
The second request was delivered on 
<a href="/blog/2013/07/08/lcc-o.html" >08<sup>th</sup> July 2013</a> 
and acknowledged on 
<a href="/blog/2013/07/09/lcc-i.html" >9<sup>th</sup> July 2013</a>.  
As far as I can recall this was equally futile, 
but I am unable to locate the response (if any) that I received, 
mainly as a result of disruption and disorganisation caused in the aftermath of a 
<a href="/blog/2015/05/10/fire.html">domestic fire</a> 
in May 2015 after which I was hospitalised.
</p>

<p>
I was advised by a local councillor of a forthcoming meeting of the board, 
scheduled to take place on 16<sup>th</sup> November 2016, 
and it was suggested to me that I submit a 
<a href="/blog/2016/11/14/lcc-o.html" >formal complaint</a> 
ahead of this.  You will find this complaint attached.
</p>

<p>
Please note that this was sent to Councillor John Browne’s <em>Gmail</em>.  
The reason for this was because in the past, attempts to contact him 
at his official County Council email were unsuccessful.
</p>

<p>
On Thursday 17<sup>th</sup> November, the morning after the meeting, I received 
the following text message from Councillor Browne, timestamped 17/11/2016 at 10:13.
<br /><cite>Mel, Being on the board of Longford Pool Construction Company Ltd, 
I am now precluded from discussions with you.  John.</cite><br />
If true, two further councillors who sit on the board, would also be precluded.
</p>

<p>
As established by telephone, Councillor Mae Sexton does not believe this preclusion 
to be genuine, and I forwarded her the documents attached here.  
These were sent to her County Council address as I don’t have a personal email address for her, 
on 14<sup>th</sup> December 2016.  I marked the correspondence <cite>important</cite> and 
requested receipt at 19:03.  I sent a second ‘dummy’ email a minute later, 
to verify that attachments would not be given as a reason for non-delivery.
</p>

<p>
In all such email instances to Longford Co. Council addresses, 
<em>neither confirmation of delivery, nor delivery failure was received</em>. 
This suggests to me that emails from me are being filtered and quarantined.  
If this is indeed the case, it would raise yet another Freedom of Information request as to why. 
It appears to be a deliberate attempt to deprive me of representation.
</p>

<p>
I have been unable to contact your offices by phone as the number appears 
to be unmanned, but will leave a message with contact details when this is sent. 
I am hoping that you will be able to help by re-submitting my request on my behalf, 
to the Freedom of Information Officer at Longford Co. Council.
</p>

<p>
To expedite matters, I wish to advise you that you have my full permission 
to access all available records and otherwise act on my behalf, as this 
<a href="/blog/2016/11/14/lcc-o.html" >most recent request</a> has been 
overdue a response since 14th December 2016, 
and I believe this to be a tactic to time-out potential legal redress. 
I also authorise your staff, to submit an additional request 
seeking the reason why my emails are being quarantined.
</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance for your help.</p>
