<p>Dear Minister Kelly,</p>


<p>I am most dissatisfied with 
<a href="/blog/2015/02/24/min-i.html"> your response</a> 
of 24 February 2015 to 
<em><b>correspondence registered to you on 12 February detailing misconduct 
of a most serious nature</b></em> NOT ONLY by the Ombudsman, but by members 
of Longford Co. Council.</p>

<p>Unbelieveably, your conclusion was <cite>I trust this clarifies the situation 
for you</cite>, having given a glib paragraph of the function of the Ombudsman, 
when it functions in the manner intended.  This <em><b>breath-taking arrogance 
</b></em>entirely ignored the greatest part of the complaint, that being the 
behaviour of members of Longford Co. Council.</p>

<p>For your attention, I have enclosed all of the following, some for a SECOND time:
<ul>
<li>Your patronising prevarication, masquerading as a response to the genuine
	concerns raised in...</li>
<li>...my registered letter to you on 12 February 2015, 
	which <em><b>does not appear to have been read.</b></em></li>
<li>My <a href="/blog/2014/11/06/affidavit1.html" >AFFIDAVIT</a>
	affirming my version of events to be correct.</li>
<li>Attachment accompanying the affidavit addressed 
	<a href="/blog/2014/01/06/gda-o.html" >
	to former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan.</a></li>
<li>Attachment accompanying the affidavit 
	addressed to Mr. Francis Sheridan, Longford Co. Council.</li>
<li>My <a href="/blog/2014/03/04/ooo-o.html">notice of intent to appeal</a>
the initial &quot;finding&quot; by the Office of the Ombudsman, 04 March 2014.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>I remind you that <em><b>you are the Minister for Local Government</b></em>, 
and I expect and demand that concerns of the type that I raised, 
be taken seriously and addressed.</p>

<p>Had I not so already, I would have expected you to direct me to the 
Office of the Ombudsman for resolution.  In light of the abysmal failure
of the Ombudsman to perform his duties, I believe 
<em><b>you should compel the Ombudsman to the Oireachtas</b></em>,
 as you referred to.</p>

<p><em><b>I cannot over-stress the importance</b></em> to you of having 
effective oversight, transparent process and fair procedure, to 
<em><b>prevent public officials acting with impunity, 
as they have done in this case, and I am fully resolved, 
with or without your assistance, to get the vindication I require, 
in an envelope with a harp</b></em> and will not settle for the type of 
default brush-off already received</p>

Yours sincerely
