<p>Dear Mr McWeeney</p>

<p>I refer to previous correspondence regarding your appeal of the 
Ombudsman decision concerning your complaint against Longford County Council.

You lodged <a href="/blog/2014/03/04/ooo-o.html" >your appeal</a> with this Office on 4 March 2014.
<a href="/blog/2014/03/10/ooo-i.html">I wrote to you on 10 March 2014</a>
<a title="Inviting?!!"<mark>inviting</mark> you to provide
additional information in support of your appeal.</a>

<a title="You really are too kind...">At your request</a> 
I suspended consideration of your appeal on 7 April 2014 
to allow you additional time to provide further information
in support of your appeal.
<em><b>You were seeking to obtain a copy of the Council's report
to this Office.</b></em>
</p>

<p>I understand that your separate requests,
<a href="#" >under FOI</a> and
<a href="#" >Data Protection</a> legislation for a copy 
of the Council's report <em><b>have both been refused 
by this Office</b></em>.
I also understand that you are considering appealing these decisions
to the Office of the Information Commissioner 
and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner respectively.
<em><b>I wish to inform you that it will not be possible to suspend
your appeal indefinitely pending the outcome of your appeals to these 
<mark><a title="All other offices get a small 'o'">o</a></mark>ffices.
</b></em>
</p>
<p>
I must now inform you that 
<em><b>I intend to proceed with your appeal</b></em> 
and to assign it to a Senior Investigator who was not previously 
involved in the examination of your complaint.
<em><b>
<mark><a title="Seven postal days at the height of the holiday season">
If you wish to provide any further additional information in support 
of your appeal you should do so by 1 August 2014</a></mark>.
</b></em>
</p>
