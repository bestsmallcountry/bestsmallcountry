<h3>Thank you Nenagh</h3>
<p>
Have to say, the people of Nenagh were most hospitable, 
and the first thing that happened was a lady went and bought me a coffee.
People came up and told me their frustrations with the Minister
honked their car horns and otherwise expressed support.

<p>The obvious lingering question is: &quot;How did he get reelected?&quot;</p>
