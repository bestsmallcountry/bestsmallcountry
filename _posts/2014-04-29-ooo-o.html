<p>Dear Aidan,</p>

<p>I am very conscious of the impetus on me to make my final statements 
ahead of the appeal, and that this is my <em><b>final opportunity</b></em> to do so. 
It would appear that I will be compelled to do so <em><b>blindfolded</b></em>, 
without the very report that caused the earlier adverse decision.</p>

<p>Ironically, the most recent letterhead from 
<em><b>your office boasts &quot;30 years putting it right&quot;</b></em>, 
while frustratingly at the same time, not only denying me access 
under Data Protection, but providing no confirmation of 
which precise entity submitted it. 
This comes afoot of an earlier refusal under Freedom of Information.</p>

<p><em><b>The issue here is</b></em> not the seniority of a case worker.  
<em><b>Due diligence</b></em> alone should have been sufficient 
to come to the correct conclusion. 
Information available during the examination detailed how 
one of the complainants against me refused to shake my hand 
following the slightest of accidental contact, 
yet this appears to have been counted against me. 
I recall that earlier, 
<em><b>a &quot;Pre-stage 3&quot; letter</b></em> was issued 
in order to force a response.  Subsequently, the council claimed that 
this entire issue was outside the scope of this office. 
<em><b>This is not the behaviour of a council with nothing to hide</b></em>.</p>

<p>I am particularly disturbed by one comment made to me 
in the week prior to the examination outcome. Namely that by 
my <a href="/blog/2012/07/23/lcc-o.html" > letter to Mr. 
{% include m/dan_rooney.span content="Dan Rooney" %}
</a> of 23 Jul 2012, 
I <cite>&quot;did myself no favours&quot;</cite>. 
Given the context of immanent exam pressure 
and my mother having fallen terminally ill, 
<em><b>what I expressed was entirely justified, 
and I have nothing to retract</b></em>. 
Offending a brittle ego is neither an "incident", 
nor a reason to deny me a swim.</p>

<p>It hasn't escaped my attention either, 
that from the moment that report arrived at your offices, 
attitudes changed immediately. 
I must reiterate that the content is <em><b>entirely unsubstantiated</b></em>, 
and can only conclude that <em><b>it is entirely false</b></em>. 
For that reason I DO NOT accept the conclusions in 
<a href="#" >Andrew Patterson's letter</a> of 17 April 2014, 
and have appealed the decision to the Data Protection Commissioner as suggested.
</p>

<p>Natural justice would demand, irrespective of legal compulsion, 
that I have access to the report I'm expected to rebut. 
Should this Office be interested in establishing the truth, 
surely this should be conceded, 
particularly given it's adverse effect to date. 
Having read the main provisions of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012, 
<em><b>I don't rule out requesting certain points of quoted law 
to be referred to the High Court for determination.</b></em></p>

<p><em><b>What I've experienced is pure discrimination</b></em>, 
and has nothing to do with &quot;incidents&quot;. 
Had it occurred due to membership of a named category of society, 
legal redress would have been greatly simplified. 
<em><b>This originated from malicious individuals</b></em>, 
not all of whose identities are known to me yet.</p>

<p>Irrespective of the outcome of my efforts to obtain this report, 
I have <em><b>two remaining pieces of correspondence to submit</b></em> 
prior to the appeal. One of these will be details of 
<em><b>Garda deployment against me</b></em>, 
the other will be <em><b>my account</b></em> of events. 
For the reasons outlined above, 
<em><b>I will withhold these</b></em> submissions 
until a final decision on the report has been received.</p>
