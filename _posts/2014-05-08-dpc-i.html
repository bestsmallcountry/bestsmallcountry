<p>Dear Mr McWeeney</p>

<p>
I refer to 
<a href="/blog/2014/04/28/dpc-o.html">your recent email</a> to this Office.
</p>

<p>A very small number of agencies are not required to deal with access
requests under the Data Protection Acts. The 
{% include m/peter_tyndall.span content="Office of the Ombudsman" %}
is one
of those organisations. While we do not have sight of the response that you
have received from The Office of the Ombudsman, there is a legal basis
which provides that they do not have to provide access to information which
they have 
{% include m/longford_county_council.span content="obtained" %} 
in the course of an 
{% include m/danny_smith.span content="investigation" %} 
{% include m/aidan_moore.span content="or" %}  
{% include m/andrew_patterson.span content="examination." %}</p>

<p>Accordingly it would appear that 
{% include m/data_protection.span content="this Office" %} 
is not in a position to investigate this matter on your behalf.</p>
