Mr Mel McWeeney<br />

<br />
Dear Mr McWeeney<br />
</div>

<p>
I refer to your <a href="/blog/2014/07/02/ooo-o.html" >previous correspondence</a> 
in connection with your appeal of 
<a href="/blog/2014/02/25/ooo-i.html" > this Office's decision</a> 
{% include m/ronan_mcnevin.span content="not" %}
{% include m/barry_hall.span content="to" %}
{% include m/mary_denneny.span content="uphold" %} 
{% include m/peggy_nolan.span content="your" %} 
{% include m/padraig_loughrey.span content="complaint" %}
{% include m/john_browne.span content="against" %}
{% include m/gerry_warnock.span content="Longford" %}
{% include m/paddy_mahon.span content="County" %}  
{% include m/dan_rooney.span content="Council." %} 
</p>

<p>
In line with the Office's appeals procedure, I have asked Mr. Sean Garvey, 
Senior Investigator, to examine your appeal. It is expected that 
{% include m/office_of_the_ombudsman.span content="your appeal" %}
will be completed within 4-6 weeks.
</p>

<p>
If it appears, however, that the appeal will take longer than expected, 
Mr. Garvey will advise you accordingly.
</p>
