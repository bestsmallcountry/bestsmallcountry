Subject: Misinformation at the Office of the Ombudsman

Refs: OF/COM/004/02 (Office of the Ombudsman -Data Protection request).
        L30/13/1772 (Office of the Ombudsman -Case number)


Dear Commissioner,

</div>

<p>Longford County Council/s recently submitted a false report of events
involving me to the Office of the Ombudsman. This had the adverse affect
of the Ombudsman's examination process being unable to uphold my complaint.
The arguement given for this failure was their inability to determine the
truth given <em>two diametrically opposing versions of events</em>.
The case is now pending appeal.</p>

<p><em>My attempts to date to access this report to date under Freedom of
Information have been denied due to an exemption</em> covering reports created
for the Ombudsman subsequent to the start of an examination or
investigation.</p>

<p>I more recently requested it under the Data Protection Act but have been
refused for reasons I don't entirely understand, and which, if anything,
would have indicated that I am entitled to it. I intend responding to that
effect in the coming days.<p>

<p>I would have considered the Office of the Ombudsman to have been above the
blind acceptance of unsubstantiated hearsay and lies as factual, but this
<em>&quot;detailed report&quot;</em> as they refer to it, has already been used to my
detriment.</p>

<p>As I know my version of events to be correct and honest, the Office of the
Ombudsman are being entirely incorrect by referring to this report as
"information", and for that reason, I don't believe their interpretation of
the law to be correct.<p>

<p>Specifically, they have referred to:
<div class="ref">
* Section 9(1) of the Ombudsman Act 1980; "Information... shall not be
disclosed... except for the purposes envisaged in...
" Subsections (1)(a)...; "...the examination or investigation...".
</div>
<p>

<p>I interpret this to mean that for the purposes of an investigation or
examination, there is no compulsion to withhold. I disagree with their
assertion that Section 4 of the Data Protection Act, 1988 applies in this
case, because my contention is that the report in question is
"misinformation", and not "information" regarding things I supposedly did,
and that any CCTV or cross-examination of me will show this to be the case.
</p>

<p>This misinformation is being used as a pretext to prevent me from swimming
at Longford Sports and Leisure Centre, a council facility. I believe that
malicious individuals <em>&quot;organised complaints&quot; 
malicious individuals <em>&quot;organised complaints&quot; 
to bring about this outcome,as I've done nothing wrong.</p>

It is absolutely essential that I be provided with the information therein,
before submitting my final rebuttal ahead of the Ombudsman appeal, as there
will not be another opportunity, and my good name depends on a successful
appeal.

Kindest regards,
Mel McWeeney.
