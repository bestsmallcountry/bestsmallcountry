<p>Dear Commissioner,</p>
<p>
{% include m/francis_sheridan.span content="Longford" %} 
{% include m/dan_rooney.span content="County" %} 
Council/s recently submitted a false report of events involving me to the 
{% include m/office_of_the_ombudsman.span content="Office of the Ombudsman." %} 
This had the adverse affect
of the Ombudsman's examination process being unable to uphold my complaint.
The argument given for this failure was their inability to determine the
truth given <em>two diametrically opposing versions of events</em>.
The case is now pending appeal.</p>

<p><em>My attempts to date to access this report to date under Freedom of
Information have been denied due to an exemption</em> covering reports created
for the Ombudsman subsequent to the start of an examination or
investigation.</p>

<p>I more recently requested it under the 
{% include m/data_protection.span content="Data Protection" %}
Act but have been
refused for reasons I don't entirely understand, and which, if anything,
would have indicated that I am entitled to it. I intend responding to that
effect in the coming days.<p>

<p>I would have considered the Office of the Ombudsman to have been above the
blind acceptance of unsubstantiated hearsay and lies as factual, but this
<em>&quot;detailed report&quot;</em> as they refer to it, has already been used to my
detriment.</p>

<p>As I know my version of events to be correct and honest, the Office of the
Ombudsman are being entirely incorrect by referring to this report as
&quot;information&quot;, and for that reason, I don't believe their interpretation of
the law to be correct.<p>

<p>Specifically, they have referred to:
<div class="ref">
* Section 9(1) of the Ombudsman Act 1980; "Information... shall not be
disclosed... except for the purposes envisaged in...
" Subsections (1)(a)...; "...the examination or investigation...".
</div>
<p>

<p>I interpret this to mean that for the purposes of an investigation or
examination, there is no compulsion to withhold. I disagree with their
assertion that Section 4 of the Data Protection Act, 1988 applies in this
case, because my contention is that the report in question is
"misinformation", and not "information" regarding things I supposedly did,
and that any CCTV or cross-examination of me will show this to be the case.
</p>

<p>This misinformation is being used as a pretext to prevent me from swimming
at Longford Sports and Leisure Centre, a council facility. I believe that
malicious individuals <em>&quot;organised complaints&quot; 
malicious individuals <em>&quot;organised complaints&quot; 
to bring about this outcome,as I've done nothing wrong.</p>

<p>
It is absolutely essential that I be provided with the information therein,
before submitting my final rebuttal ahead of the Ombudsman appeal, as there
will not be another opportunity, and my good name depends on a successful
appeal.
</p>
