</div>

<p>
I wish to acknowledge receipt of your
<a href="/blog/2013/06/04/lcc-o.html" > Freedom of Information request</a> on the
5<sup>th</sup> June 2013 seeking records that may be held by
Longford Sports and Leisure Ltd. in relation to policies and procedures.

I, also, wish to acknowledge receipt of up-front fee of €30 and I enclose
receipt <em>No.CASH/0/103354</em> in relation to the fee.

However, since the appropriate up-front fee for a mixed request is €15,
I will arrange as agreed with you by telephone on the 7<sup>th</sup> June
2013 to refund you the balance of €15.
</p>

<p>
A decision on your request will normally be sent to you within 4 weeks
(20 working days) of receipt of your request which means that you can expect 
to receive your decision by the 2<sup>nd</sup> July 2013.
</p>


<p>
If you have not received your decision on the expiry of the allotted time
you are entitled to appeal to Longford County Council for a review of the matter 
based on the premise that the initial request is considerede to be refused 
once the specidied time for responding to it has expired.

The review will be a new examination of the matter carried out by 
a more senior member of staff of the Council.

In the event that you need to make such an appeal you can do so by writing 
within 4 weeks (after the date given for the initial devision) 
to the Senior Executive Officer, Human Resources, Longford County Council, 
Aras an Chontae, Gt. Water St., Longford.

You should state that you are appealing because an initial decision was not 
received by you within the time permitted.
