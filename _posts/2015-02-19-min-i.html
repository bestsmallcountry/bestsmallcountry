<p>Dear Mr. McWeeney,</p>

<p>
I have been asked by Mr. Alan Kelly, Minister for the Environment,
Community and Local Government, to acknowledge receipt of your 
<a href="/blog/2015/02/12/min-o.html">recent letter</a> 
in connection with a formal complaint of Misconduct against the 
<a title="and no mention of local authorities?"<i>Ombudsman</i></a>.</p>

<p>
The Ombudsman's legal authority to investigate complaints, 
and to recommend redress where necessary, is set out primarily in
the Ombudsman Act 1980, which outlines the powers of the 
{% include m/office_of_the_ombudsman.span content="Ombudsman" %} 
in relation to the examination and investigation of complaints made to him.
The Act also defines the Ombudsman's 
<a title="This is the mechanism I want activated"><i>reporting relationship 
with the Dail and Seanad</i></a>.
The Ombudsman is independent in the performance of his functions and the
Minister has no role in this matter.</p> 

<p>
I trust this clarifies the situation for you.
</p>
