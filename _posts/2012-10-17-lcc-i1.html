Dear Mr. McWeeney<br />
</div>

<p>
I refer to <a href="/blog/2012/07/19/lcc-i.html" >my letter to you
dated 19<sup>th</sup> July, 2012</a> and
<a href="/blog/2012/07/23/lcc-o.html" >your response</a> 
received in writing on 24<sup>th</sup> July, 2012.
The Swimming Pool Management have considered your written response.
You have requested that you be given details of what exactly you are
supposed to have done.
<em><b>You then proceed in your letter to describe the incidents
as trivial incidents and abrasively criticise me</b></em>
for raising these issues with you.</p>

<p>In accordance with your request I now set out the history of the 
case as reported yo myself and I request that you consider same and
let me have your response in due course:-</p>

<section>
<h2>Early 2012</h2>
<p>
You were involved in an incident in the Pool with another member.
You were swimming in the lane and 
you tried to cut off a female swimmer by overtaking her 
and then cutting in front of her obstructing her swim.
<mark>
You then stated that you were swimming in the middle of the lane.
The lady's husband was present and saw this incident.
There was a verbal argument between you and him.
The lady alleged that you were bullying her in the lane
and verbally threatened her as well.
The lifeguard on deck Sharon Treacy brought this incident to the
	attention of David Sheridan.
	She had seen the arguement but not the bullying incident.</mark>

Centre Assistant manager states:-
<cite>&quot;
I went down to the Pool area and I spoke to both men Mel McWeeney and 
and the other man.  Mr. Atkins was very upset that 
Mel McWeeney had threatened his wife and was bullying
that it is a public facility and that people might bump into each
other by accident.
I encouraged them not to be agressive reminding both that they are 
of good character and they shook hands and apologised to each other

<h2>11-07-2012</h2>
<p>Florrie Geelan gives a hand-written complaint
to the Swimming pool stating that
<a title="You couldn't make this up, she got the slightest 
accidental toe-poke, that couldn't possibly have hurt" >
<cite>&quot;
I was swimming in the mall Swimming Pool in Longford.
I got kicked twice by a man with no manners.
When I left the pool I went into the Steam Room.
The same man came in and tried to bully me so I left.
I only came in for a swim which I always enjoy 
but today this man made it impossible.  Thank you.
&quot;</cite>
</a></p>
<p>David states
<cite>&quot;
This lady gave me this letter by hand.
Her name is Florrie Geelan from Newtownforbes.
On this very same day, I met Mel McWeeney in the swimming pool and I
<a title="Not summonsed?">invited him into the office with another 
member of staff, Mr. Barry Hall, Duty Manager</a>.
I told him that I had received a written complaint about him.
I told him that this was the second written complaint that I had
received in the past few months and that I was going to look into
the matter.
He left suggesting that Florrie Geelan was a very rude woman and
he felt that he was the victim.
I told him I would have to look into the matter.
Later Mel approached the lady and tried to apologise but she
declined to shake his hand
