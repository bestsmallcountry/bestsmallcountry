you are entitled to appeal to Longford County Council for a review
of the matter based on the premise that the initial request is considered 
to be refused once the specified time for responding to it has expired.

The review will be a new examination of the matter carried out by a more 
senior member of staff of the Council.

In the event that you need to make such an appeal you can do so in writing 
within 4 weeks (after the date given for the initial decision) to the 
Senior Executive Officer,
Human Resources,
Longford County Council,
Aras an Chontae,
Gt. Water St.,

You should state that you are appealing because an initial decision was 
not received by you within the time permitted.
