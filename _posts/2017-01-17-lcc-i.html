<blockquote>
<p>
Under Freedom of Information, I am formally requesting the

and full details of any discussions in relation to me.
</p>
<p>
The Board of Longford Pool Construction, individually and as a collective, 
have to date endorsed all actions against me to date.

<p>
A decision on your request will normally be sent to you  within 4 weeks
(20 working days) of receipt of your request which means that you can

<p>
If you have not received your decision by the expiry of the allotted time
you are entitled to appeal to Longford County Council for a review
of the matter based on the premise that the initial request is considered 
to be refused once the specified time for responding to it has expired.

The review will be a new examination of the matter carried out by a more 
member of staff of the Council.

In the event that you need to make such an appeal you can do so in writing 
within 4 weeks (after the date given for the initial decision) to the 
Senior Executive Officer,

Longford County Council,
Aras an Chontae,
Gt. Water St.,

You should state that you are appealing because an initial decision was 
not received by you within the time permitted.
