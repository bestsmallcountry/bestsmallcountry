Dear Mr. McWeeney,<br />
</div>

<p>I am writing to you in relation to a number of 
<a href="/blog/2012/10/17/lcc-i1.html" >complaints</a> 
that have been brought to my attention pertaining to you 
while using the facilities at Longford Sports &amp; Leisure Centre.</p>

<p>These complaints relate to alleged incidents in the pool 
over the past three months.

David Sheridan

Assistant Manager has spoken to you and made you aware that there has 
been one verbal and two written complaints made 
about your behaviour in the swimming pool.</p>
<p>The complaints specifically relate to incidents of 
bullying and verbal abuse.</p>
<p>These are considered very serious matters and we do not condone
any such acts at Longford Sports &amp; Leisure Centre. </p>
