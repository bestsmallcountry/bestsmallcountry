Dear Mr. McWeeney,<br />
</div>

<p>I am writing to you in relation to a number of 
<a href="/blog/2012/10/17/lcc-i1.html" >complaints</a> 
that have been brought to my attention pertaining to you 
while using the facilities at Longford Sports &amp; Leisure Centre.</p>

<p>These complaints relate to alleged incidents in the pool 
over the past three months.

{% include m/david_sheridan.span content="David Sheridan" %},
Assistant Manager has spoken to you and made you aware that there has 
been one verbal and two written complaints made 
about your behaviour in the swimming pool.</p>
<p>The complaints specifically relate to incidents of 
bullying and verbal abuse.</p>
<p>These are considered very serious matters and we do not condone
any such acts at Longford Sports &amp; Leisure Centre. </p>
<p>I trust you understand the severity of these complaints 
and the necessity to make you aware of these.</p>
