<p>Re:- Bullying in Swi<mark>m</mark>ing Lane</p>

<p><mark>Its</mark> common knowledge for many years that certain individuals are 
inflicting assaults on other swimmers in the lanes.  
I personally have 
<mark>numeriously</mark> been kicked and punched from under the water because 
<mark>i was i was</mark> not swimming fast enough, in the wrong lane 
<mark>etc atc.</mark>

They were not accidents!  <mark>its</mark> been going on for years and 
<mark>its</mark> the same <mark>people people</mark> who are doing it.

<em>These people are using the cover of the water to inflict assaults on 
others in the knowledge that it can't be seen from above and therefore 
they will automatically get away with it.</em> <mark>Thats</mark> an insult. 
Bullying should not be <mark>tollerated</mark>

<p>On <mark>s</mark>aturday last <mark>i</mark> was swimming in a lane alone.
I was unknowingly going the wrong way after a few laps <mark>i</mark> suddenly 
m<mark>ee</mark>t another swimmer as <mark>i</mark> was turning 
<mark>at wall</mark>.  I man<mark>ouve</mark>red out of his way but he purposely 
managed to kick me.  <mark>Its</mark> the second time he has done it.  I 
<mark>dont</mark> know his name, he <mark>is regular member</mark>.
I said it to 
{% include m/mary_denneny.span content="Mary" %}
 on <mark>Duty</mark>.
</p>

<p>Mel McWeeney thin<mark>gs</mark> he owns a <mark>L</mark>ane and 
<mark>regularily Kicks</mark> at anyone in his way and clips at their
feet if he can catch up with them.  Lots of swimmers <mark>wont</mark>
swim in the same lane as him because they don't want to be 
<mark>hasseled</mark>.  He now has his own seat in the sauna and asks 
people to move if they sit in it, <mark>HA HA</mark>
</p>

<p><mark>Bullies</mark> is a serious issue and should not be
<mark>tollerated</mark>.  <mark>Oppologies</mark> for imposing on you in this 
way, but <mark>i</mark> <mark>feel feel</mark> it too serious to be ignored.
