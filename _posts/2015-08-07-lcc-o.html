<p>Hi 
{% include m/gerry_warnock.span content="Gerry" %}
</p>

<p>
Thanks for taking my call this morning.  As you can see, this has gone on quite a while.
This archive was downloaded from a cloud service where I've uploaded them.
</p>

<p>
It is work-in-progress so many of the links need clean-up.
</p>

<p>
John Browne has a slightly older version so I'll copy him.
</p>

<p>I will continue to transcribe and publish until everything is in the cloud.</p>
<p>This is for the good of my own safety, my good name and the public interest.</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>
