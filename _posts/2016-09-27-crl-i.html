<h2>I want the reason in writing.</h2>

<p>
I have just taken a phone call from 
{% include m/james_obrien.span content="James O'Brien" %} 
at
<a href="http://longfordsportsandleisure.ie/" >Longford Sports and Leisure Centre</a>
to inform me that there's been a problem.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="/blog/2016/09/23/newmembership.html" > membership</a>
I bought during their special offer promotion 
on Friday 23<sup>rd</sup> September is not going to be honoured
and I am to be refunded the amount paid.
</p>

<p>
I have asked for the reason for this refusal to be provided in writing.
</p>


<p>Those behind this decision should make themselves, (and their reasons) known.</p>
