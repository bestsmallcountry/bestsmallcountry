<p>Dear Minister Fitzgerald,</p>

<p>I wish to acknowledge receipt of 
<a href="/blog/2014/12/19/min-i.html" > your correspondence to 
Mr. James Bannon T.D.</a> in relation to the above.</p>

<p>Although dated 19 December 2014, It was only received in mid-January 2015 
as (disappointingly) it wasn't addressed directly to me, 
hence the delay responding.</p>
<p>That aside, I remain <em><b>deeply dissatisfied with your response</b></em>, 
primarily for the following reasons:

<ol>
	<li>There is no indication that my <a href="/blog/2014/11/06/affidavit1.html" > 
	affidavit</a> has even been read. To ensure it is, I (again) enclose a copy.</li>
	<li>Had it been read, you might have appreciated the 
	<em><b>devastating daily disruption this ongoing situation is causing. 
	My life, livelihood and independence have all been destroyed</b></em>, 
	and will most likely remain so until these issues have been resolved, 
	which is why intervention is needed URGENTLY. 
	You are in a position to deliver, 
	and in light of your recent comments to new Garda recruits 
	regarding wrongdoing, I expect nothing less.</li>
	<li>Given that this disruption is <em><b>now into a THIRD YEAR</b></em>, 
	and that <a href="/blog/2014/08/06/min-o.html" > my first corresondence </a> 
	with your department dates back to 20 August 2014, 
	the lack of any timeline is extremely worrying.</li>
	<li>I am deeply concerned that a &quot;paper only&quot; exercise 
	will lack the required transparency, particularly since the 
	<em><b>absolutely disgusting and disgraceful behaviour 
	of both the 
	{% include m/office_of_the_ombudsman.span content="Office of the Ombudsman" %}
	and certain Gardai</b></em> to date. 
	I must have reassurance that this review will finally be an honest exercise, 
	and not simply a further cover-up.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>This is not simply a Garda issue, but also a 
<em><b>matter of civil rights and equality</b></em> 
(for which you are ALSO the Minister), and for that reason I CANNOT accept 
that the meeting I seek would <cite>&quot;not be appropriate&quot;</cite> 
as you stated in previous correspondence. 
If &quot;equality&quot; is available to the masses, 
and not just to special named social categories, 
then to the contrary, it could hardly be more appropriate.
<em><b>For me to suffer, so as to gratify the

{% include m/dan_rooney.span content="sadistic" %} 
{% include m/peggy_nolan.span content="pleasures" %}

determined to demonstrate that

impunity, 
<em><b>is NOT the <cite>&quot;Democratic Revolution&quot;</cite></b></em> 
or the <cite>&quot;New way of doing politics&quot;</cite> 
that we were promised in advance of the last General Election.</p>

<p>So, as a law abiding citizen of this country, 
and as a victim of a malicious conspiracy of lies, 
I ask you as <em><b>Minister for Equality</b></em>, 
how the organs of the Irish State can justify my ongoing punishment, 
for things I HAVE NOT done, while utterly 
<em><b>failing to hold authority figures accountable</b></em>, 
for what they HAVE.</p>
