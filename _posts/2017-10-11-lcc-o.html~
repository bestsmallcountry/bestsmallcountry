Longford Pool Construction Ltd.,
Longford County Council,
Great Water Street,
Longford.

<p>Dear 
{% include m/paddy_mahon.span content="Mr. Mahon," %}</p>

<p>
This is my fifth request under the Freedom of Information Acts to be given a valid reason
why I have, without any justification whatsoever, what appears to be a lifetime ban from
using Longford Sports and Leisure Centre, a council facility.</p>

<p>
This request under the Freedom of Information Act 2014, is the third such request made
within the past twelve months. This conclusively demonstrates the contempt of Longford
County Council both for the law, and for me personally.
</p>

<p>
My <a href="/blog/2013/03/28/lcc-o.html" >first formal complaint</a> 
was sent to Mr. 
{% include m/francis_sheridan.span content="Francis Sheridan"  %} 
on 28 March 2013. His
response placed large reliance on a 
<a href="/blog/2012/10/17/lcc-i2.html"> malicious letter</a> sent by 
{% include m/brian_gorman.span content="Brian Gorman," %} 
written in what
would appear to have been an impaired condition. Nevertheless this was afforded undue
credibility.
</p>

<p>
Under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 2014, I am obliged to be provided
with any record on any medium in relation to decisions taken that have an adverse effect
on me. Therefore I am formally requesting ALL of the following, all of which pertain to me:
</p>

<p>1: Report to Ombudsman</p>

<p>
On foot of a request from the Office of the Ombudsman, a false and malicious report was
sent on 12 February 2013 from Mr Dan Rooney directly contradicting my version of events.
This obviously depicted me in a very adverse manner, and MUST be provided to me for
perusal and correction.
</p>

<p>2: eMail archive</p>

<p>
(a): I also require a full archive of all emails received from me to addresses
@longfordcoco.ie which can be sent to me electronically. No delivery failures to any of
these addresses were ever received, nor, despite having been requested, was any
confirmation of delivery. The natural conclusion here is that they were deliberately
quarantined, and that's where the search for them can be focused.
</p>

<p>
(b): I furthermore require any records providing a reason for this decision to quarantine
these emails. There is no question that I have been singled out, so there MUST be a
record documenting the reason.
</p>

<p>3: Minutes</p>

<p>
I require all minutes from meetings of the Board of Longford Pool Construction Ltd. at
which I was discussed or mentioned. Of particular interest are minutes from 2012 when I
was initially stitched up, and the minutes referred to in my entirely ignored Freedom of
Information request in November 2016.
</p>

<p>
Upon resubmission via the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, this received 
<a href="/blog/2017/01/26/lcc-i.html" >a most hostile response</a> from 
{% include m/willie_odowd.span content="Willie O'Dowd" %} 
on 26th January 2017.
</p>

<p>4: Accountancy</p>

<p>
(a): I require documentation demonstrating that I should be refunded a sum of €174 in lieu
of €237 paid for the annual membership purchased on 23 September 2016, which is the
subject of this complaint. The receipt number is 0412 for that date.
</p>
<br />
<img src="/images/receipts/2016-10-06-corelcheque.png" alt="Cheque for €174">
<br />
<p>
(b): Furthermore I require documentation that demonstrates the authority of Siobhan Tighe
from Coral Leisure Head Office, to sign the cheque sent to me from the cheque book of
Longford Pool Construction Ltd.
</p>

<p>5: Board Members</p>

<p>
As individually and as a collective, the Board of Longford Pool Construction Ltd. have
acted against me since 2012, and continue to do so, I require a FULL list of ALL members
who have served during this time.
</p>

<p>6: Preclusions</p>

<p>
Following the meeting of Longford Pool Construction Ltd. held on 16th November 2016, I
was informed by Cllr. John Browne as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
"Mel. Being on the board of Longford Pool Construction Ltd., I am now precluded from
discussions with you". From John Browne 17/11/2016 10:13
</blockquote>

<p>
If correct, then two further members of the Council, Padraic Loughrey and Gerry Warnock
are also precluded, as are other members of the board. I do not accept that Longford Pool
Construction Ltd. has any authority to deprive me of local representation, and require
documentation to the contrary.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I remind you that there is a legal obligation on the Council to provide all of the
above to me, and I will review any response point by point. I will not hesitate to take
whatever further action is required should all of the above not be addressed in full, or
should any of the above requests be deliberately misconstrued as before.
