<p>Hi Ciara,</p>

<p>
They're much less likely to completely ignore you.  
I wonder could you give me any indication regarding 
response times we can reasonably expect, especially 
given that this was originally submitted on 14th November 2016.</p>
<p>
I would expect that the new aspect 
<em>(namely the blocking of my eMails)</em> 
start from the date of your submission yesterday, 
but I'd really like a strict deadline 
in relation to the overdue aspects.</p>
<p>Many thanks for your help.</p>
<br />

<p>Hi Mel,</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be able to give you an indication of a response time. 
I can confirm however that Longford County Council 
have acknowledged receipt of my email 
and said it would be attended to straight away.</p>
<p>I hope this information is of some assistance to you.</p>
