<h2>Whispering classes talk behind hands</h2>

That's OK most of the time because nobody is ever ever going to find out.
Those

that the spotlight would never be switched on.
Well tough look dudes, you guessed it wrong, 
and the torch is shining down on you.

<h3>And they get the backing of the Irish State</h3>

And we're not just talking about pathetic local whispering classes talking behind hands... 
We're talking about those in positions of public trust with a brief to uphold social order, 
and those tasked with ensuring the accountability of these same people to the public:

<section>
<h3>Local Authorities</h3>
<p>	... specifically Longford Co. Council in this case, 
	who for reasons best known to themselves, 
	pursued and still pursue an agenda against me.
</p>
<br /><br />
</section>

<section>
<h3>An Garda Siochana</h3>
<p>	... who they misdeployed against me
    as a result of a vexatious phone call made by a culpable 
	local authority figure.  Not surprisingly, the attending 
	{% include m/garda.span content="Garda" %}
	gave a false name.
</p>
<br /><br />
</section>

<section>
<h3>The Office of the Ombudsman</h3>
<p>	... who disregarded whatever evidence was necessary so as to 
	cover up the wrong. If 
	{% include m/ombudsman.span content="kangaroo courts" %} 
	are wrong, then why does the Irish State operate this one.
</p>
<br /><br />
</section>

<section>
<h3>The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner</h3>
	<p>... who 
	{% include m/data_protection.span content="failed to facilitate" %} 
	the correction of lies and misinformation submitted to
    the Office of the Ombudsman by Longford Co. Council.
	</p>
<br /><br />

<section>
<h3>Ministers</h3>
	<p>... in the <a href="http://alankelly.ie/">previous</a> and 
		<a href="http://francesfitzgerald.ie">present</a> governments.

<h2>What happened???</h2>
<p>
The board of Longford Sports and Leisure, acting on behalf of Longford Co. Council took
a decision to suspend the last three of a valid six month pool membership I had at the facility.
There was no basis for this decision besides the malicious hearsay of known 
{% include m/brian_gorman.span content="backstabbers" %}.
No evidence existed.  None exists. None could. No explanation worthy of the term was ever given.
</p>
<p>
While attempting to find out who or what was behind this, one of the perpetrators, a 
local official watched my efforts and with a simple phone call, misdeployed Gardai
against me as simply and quickly as other mere mortals order pizza, 
all to thwart my efforts to establish who had spread malicious lies about me.
</p>
<br /><br />

<section>
<h2>System failures</h2>
<p>
No details of my supposed wrongdoing was ever given by An Garda Siochana 
despite persistent requests.  The Gardai would never reprimand this local authority figure.
The <a href="http://francesfitzgerald.ie/">minister</a>'s response was a pre-election 
paper-only exercise.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://ombudsman.gov.ie/">Office of the Ombudsman</a> behaved abominably,
brushing aside all information and evidence that might vindicate my good name.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://dataprotection.ie/">Office of the Data Protection Commissioner</a>
have, to date, failed to facilitate the correction of the false narrative
send by <a href="http://longfordcoco.ie/">Longford County Council</a> regarding me in
what has been described as <em>a very detailed report</em> which I am attempting to gain 
access to.
</p>

<p>
No local or national politicians contacted showed any sense of outrage, or any urge to help.
